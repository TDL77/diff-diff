class TwoWayFixedEffects(DifferenceInDifferences):
    """
    Two-Way Fixed Effects (TWFE) estimator for panel DiD.

    Extends DifferenceInDifferences to handle panel data with unit
    and time fixed effects.

    Parameters
    ----------
    robust : bool, default=True
        Whether to use heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors.
    cluster : str, optional
        Column name for cluster-robust standard errors.
        If None, automatically clusters at the unit level (the `unit`
        parameter passed to `fit()`). This differs from
        DifferenceInDifferences where cluster=None means no clustering.

        **Exception:** when ``vcov_type="classical"`` and
        ``inference="analytical"``, the unit auto-cluster is dropped
        because the classical family is by construction one-way only and
        the validator rejects ``cluster_ids + classical``. The user's
        explicit choice of the classical family wins over the TWFE default
        in that narrow analytical-inference case. Under
        ``inference="wild_bootstrap"`` the auto-cluster is preserved (the
        bootstrap uses the cluster structure to resample residuals).
    alpha : float, default=0.05
        Significance level for confidence intervals.

    Notes
    -----
    This estimator uses the regression:

        Y_it = α_i + γ_t + β*(D_i × Post_t) + X_it'δ + ε_it

    where α_i are unit fixed effects and γ_t are time fixed effects.

    **HC2 / Bell-McCaffrey are not available on TWFE.** Because TWFE uses
    within-transformation (demeaning) to absorb the fixed effects, the
    reduced design's hat matrix is not the full FE projection; HC2 leverage
    and CR2 Bell-McCaffrey corrections on the demeaned design would produce
    silently-wrong small-sample SEs (FWL preserves coefficients, not the
    hat matrix). ``vcov_type in {"hc2","hc2_bm"}`` therefore raises
    ``NotImplementedError`` with workarounds: use ``vcov_type="hc1"`` (HC1/
    CR1 survive FWL), or switch to ``DifferenceInDifferences(fixed_effects=
    [...])`` where the dummies appear in the full design. Tracked in
    ``TODO.md`` under Methodology/Correctness; also documented in
    ``docs/methodology/REGISTRY.md``.

    **Conley spatial-HAC (``vcov_type="conley"``) is supported via the
    block-decomposed panel sandwich (matches R ``conleyreg`` with
    ``lag_cutoff > 0``).** Pass ``conley_coords=(lat_col, lon_col)``,
    ``conley_cutoff_km=<float>``, and ``conley_lag_cutoff=<int>`` on the
    constructor; the ``time`` / ``unit`` arrays are auto-derived from the
    estimator's ``time`` and ``unit`` column-name arguments at fit-time.
    The sandwich sums within-period spatial pairs plus within-unit
    Bartlett serial pairs (lag=0 excluded to avoid double-counting); this
    is NOT a multiplicative product kernel. FWL composability: the
    within-transformed scores ``S = X_demeaned * residuals_demeaned`` form
    the same meat as the full-dummy-expansion design. The temporal kernel
    is hardcoded Bartlett regardless of ``conley_kernel`` (matches
    ``conleyreg::time_dist``). Explicit ``cluster=<col>`` + Conley
    enables the combined spatial + cluster product kernel
    ``K_total[i, j] = K_space(d_ij/h) · 1{cluster_i = cluster_j}``;
    cluster membership must be constant within each unit across periods
    (validator-enforced on the panel block-decomposed path). When
    ``cluster=`` is unset, TWFE's default auto-cluster at the unit level
    is silently dropped on the Conley path — Conley spatial HAC alone is
    applied, not the combined kernel. Restrictions:
    ``inference="wild_bootstrap"`` + Conley raises (incompatible inference
    modes); ``survey_design=`` + Conley raises (Phase 5 follow-up).

    Warning: TWFE can be biased with staggered treatment timing
    and heterogeneous treatment effects. Consider using
    more robust estimators (e.g., Callaway-Sant'Anna) for
    staggered designs.

        Parameters
        ----------
        data : pd.DataFrame
            Panel data with unit and time identifiers.
        outcome : str
            Name of outcome variable column.
        unit : str
            Name of unit identifier column.
        time : str
            Name of time period column.
        first_treat : str
            Name of column indicating when each unit was first treated.
            The values ``0`` and ``np.inf`` are **reserved as
            never-treated sentinels**; a real treatment cohort with
            ``first_treat == 0`` would be folded into ``U`` and should
            be re-labeled to a non-sentinel value before fitting. Units
            whose ``first_treat`` is at or before the first observable
            period (``first_treat <= min(time)``, excluding the
            sentinels) are automatically remapped to the ``U``
            (untreated) bucket per Goodman-Bacon (2021) footnote 11
            with a ``UserWarning``. See ``BaconDecomposition.fit()`` for
            the full contract and
            ``BaconDecompositionResults.n_always_treated_remapped`` for
            the count. The user's original ``first_treat`` column is
            preserved unchanged.
        weights : str, default="exact"
            Weight calculation method:

            - "exact" (default): Variance-based weights from Goodman-Bacon
              (2021) Theorem 1, Eqs. 7-9 and 10e-g. Paper-faithful and
              the standard methodology contract.
            - "approximate": Fast simplified formula. Opt in for
              speed-sensitive diagnostic loops; numerical output may
              differ from R ``bacondecomp::bacon()``.

        Returns
        -------
        BaconDecompositionResults
            Decomposition results showing:
            - TWFE estimate and its weighted-average breakdown
            - List of all 2x2 comparisons with estimates and weights
            - Total weight by comparison type (clean vs forbidden)

        Examples
        --------
        >>> twfe = TwoWayFixedEffects()
        >>> decomp = twfe.decompose(
        ...     data, outcome='y', unit='id', time='t', first_treat='treat_year'
        ... )
        >>> decomp.print_summary()
        >>> # Check weight on forbidden comparisons
        >>> if decomp.total_weight_later_vs_earlier > 0.2:
        ...     print("Warning: significant forbidden comparison weight")

        Notes
        -----
        This decomposition is essential for understanding potential TWFE bias
        in staggered adoption designs. The three comparison types are:

        1. **Treated vs Never-treated**: Clean comparisons using never-treated
           units as controls. These are always valid.

        2. **Earlier vs Later treated**: Uses later-treated units as controls
           before they receive treatment. These are valid.

        3. **Later vs Earlier treated**: Uses already-treated units as controls.
           These "forbidden comparisons" can introduce bias when treatment
           effects are dynamic (changing over time since treatment).
