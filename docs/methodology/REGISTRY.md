# Methodology Registry

This document provides the academic foundations and key implementation requirements for each estimator in diff-diff. It serves as a reference for contributors and users who want to understand the theoretical basis of the methods.

**Result-class field naming.** Headline scalar inference fields appear under one of four native naming patterns: flat `att` / `se` / `conf_int` / `p_value` / `t_stat` (`DiDResults`, `SyntheticDiDResults`, `TROPResults`, `HeterogeneousAdoptionDiDResults`); `overall_*` (`CallawaySantAnnaResults` and the rest of the staggered family); `overall_att_*` (`ContinuousDiDResults`, where `att` and `acrt` are parallel response curves); and `avg_*` (`MultiPeriodDiDResults`). Every scalar treatment-effect result class covered by this naming contract additionally exposes the flat `att` / `se` / `conf_int` / `p_value` / `t_stat` names as read-only `@property` aliases for adapter / external-consumer compatibility (see PR for v3.3.3, motivated by `balance.interop.diff_diff`); `ContinuousDiDResults` further exposes `overall_*` aliases pointing at the ATT side. The native field is canonical for documentation, semantics, and computation — aliases are pure read-throughs and inherit the `safe_inference()` joint-NaN consistency contract automatically. Because aliases are `@property` descriptors (not dataclass fields), they do NOT appear in `dataclasses.fields()` or `dataclasses.asdict()` output, and assignment to an alias raises `AttributeError`; serializers and field-walkers continue to see only the canonical field set.

- Angrist, J.D., & Pischke, J.-S. (2009). *Mostly Harmless Econometrics*. Princeton University Press.

**Key implementation requirements:**

*Assumption checks / warnings:*
- Treatment and post indicators must be binary (0/1) with variation in both
- Warns if no treated units in pre-period or no control units in post-period
- Parallel trends assumption is untestable but can be assessed with pre-treatment data

*Estimator equation (as implemented):*
```
ATT = (Ȳ_{treated,post} - Ȳ_{treated,pre}) - (Ȳ_{control,post} - Ȳ_{control,pre})
    = E[Y(1) - Y(0) | D=1]
```

Regression form:
```
Y_it = α + β₁(Treated_i) + β₂(Post_t) + τ(Treated_i × Post_t) + X'γ + ε_it
```
where τ is the ATT.

*Standard errors:*
- Default: HC1 heteroskedasticity-robust
- Optional: Cluster-robust (specify `cluster` parameter)
- Optional: Wild cluster bootstrap for small number of clusters

*Edge cases:*
- Empty cells (e.g., no treated-pre observations) cause rank deficiency, handled per `rank_deficient_action` setting
  - With "warn" (default): emits warning, sets NaN for affected coefficients
  - With "error": raises ValueError
  - With "silent": continues silently with NaN coefficients
- Singleton clusters (one observation): included in variance estimation; contribute to meat matrix via u_i² X_i X_i' (same formula as larger clusters with n_g=1)
- Rank-deficient design matrix (collinearity): warns and sets NA for dropped coefficients (R-style, matches `lm()`)
  - Tolerance: `1e-07` (matches R's `qr()` default), relative to largest diagonal element of R in QR decomposition
  - Controllable via `rank_deficient_action` parameter: "warn" (default), "error", or "silent"

**Reference implementation(s):**
- R: `fixest::feols()` with interaction term
- Stata: `reghdfe` or manual regression with interaction

**Requirements checklist:**
- [x] Treatment and time indicators are binary 0/1 with variation
- [x] ATT equals coefficient on interaction term
- [x] Wild bootstrap supports Rademacher, Mammen, Webb weight distributions
- [x] Formula interface parses `y ~ treated * post` correctly

  identification, and estimation in the linear panel event-study design. NBER Working Paper 29170.

**Scope:** Simultaneous adoption event study. All treated units receive treatment at the
same time. For staggered adoption (different units treated at different times), use
CallawaySantAnna or SunAbraham instead.

**Key implementation requirements:**

*Assumption checks / warnings:*
- Treatment indicator must be binary (0/1) with variation in both groups
- Requires at least 1 pre-treatment and 1 post-treatment period
- Warns when only 1 pre-period available (≥2 needed to test parallel trends;
  ATT is still valid but pre-trends assessment is not possible)
- Reference period defaults to last pre-treatment period (e=-1 convention)
- Treatment indicator should be time-invariant ever-treated (D_i);
  warns when time-varying D_it detected (requires `unit` parameter)
- Warns if treatment timing varies across units when `unit` is provided
  (suggests CallawaySantAnna or SunAbraham instead)
- Treatment must be an absorbing state (once treated, always treated)

*Estimator equation (target specification):*

With unit and time fixed effects absorbed:

```
Y_it = α_i + γ_t + Σ_{e≠-1} δ_e × D_i × 1(t = E + e) + X'β + ε_it
```

where:
- α_i = unit fixed effects (absorbed)
- γ_t = time fixed effects (absorbed)
- E = common treatment time (same for all treated units)
- D_i = treatment group indicator (1=treated, 0=control)
- e = t - E = event time (relative periods to treatment)
- δ_e = treatment effect at event time e
- δ_{-1} = 0 (reference period, omitted for identification)

For simultaneous treatment, this is equivalent to interacting treatment with
calendar-time indicators:

```
Y_it = α_i + γ_t + Σ_{t≠t_ref} δ_t × (D_i × Period_t) + X'β + ε_it
```

where interactions are included for ALL periods (pre and post), not just post-treatment.

Pre-treatment coefficients (e < -1) test the parallel trends assumption:
under H0 of parallel trends, δ_e = 0 for all e < 0.

Post-treatment coefficients (e ≥ 0) estimate dynamic treatment effects.

Average ATT over post-treatment periods:

```
ATT_avg = (1/|post|) × Σ_{e≥0} δ_e
```

with SE computed from the sub-VCV matrix:

```
Var(ATT_avg) = 1'V1 / |post|²
```

where V is the VCV sub-matrix for post-treatment δ_e coefficients.

*Standard errors:*
- Default: HC1 heteroskedasticity-robust (same as DifferenceInDifferences base class)
- Alternative: Cluster-robust at unit level via `cluster` parameter (recommended for panel data)
- `vcov_type="hc2_bm"` (one-way) computes HC2 + Imbens-Kolesar (2016) Satterthwaite DOF
  per coefficient and a contrast-aware DOF for the post-period-average ATT.
- **Note:** `cluster` + `vcov_type="hc2_bm"` is **not supported** and raises
  `NotImplementedError`. The cluster-aware CR2 Bell-McCaffrey contrast DOF for the
  post-period-average ATT (Pustejovsky-Tipton 2018 per-cluster adjustment matrices
  applied to an arbitrary aggregation contrast) is not yet implemented. Pairing CR2
  cluster-robust SEs with the one-way Imbens-Kolesar contrast DOF would be a broken
  hybrid, so the combination fails fast. Workarounds: drop `cluster` for one-way
  HC2+BM, or keep `cluster` with the default `vcov_type="hc1"` for CR1 (Liang-Zeger).
  Tracked in `TODO.md` under Methodology/Correctness.
- Optional: Wild cluster bootstrap (complex for multi-coefficient testing;
  requires joint bootstrap distribution)
- Degrees of freedom adjusted for absorbed fixed effects

*Edge cases:*
- Reference period: omitted from design matrix; coefficient is zero by construction.
  Default is last pre-treatment period (e=-1). User can override via `reference_period`.
- Post-period reference: raises ValueError. Post-period references would exclude a
  post-treatment period from estimation, biasing avg_att and breaking downstream inference.
- Reference period default change: FutureWarning emitted when `reference_period` is not
  explicitly specified and ≥2 pre-periods exist, noting the default changed from first
  to last pre-period (e=-1 convention, matching fixest/did).
- Never-treated units: all event-time indicators are zero; they identify the time
  fixed effects and serve as comparison group.
- Endpoint binning: distant event times (e.g., e < -K or e > K) should be binned
  into endpoint indicators to avoid sparse cells. This prevents imprecise estimates
  at extreme leads/lags.
- Unbalanced panels: only uses observations where event-time is defined. Units
  not observed at all event times contribute to the periods they are present for.
- Rank-deficient design matrix (collinearity): warns and sets NA for dropped
  coefficients (R-style, matches `lm()`)
- Average ATT (`avg_att`) is NA if any post-period effect is unidentified
  (R-style NA propagation)
- NaN inference for undefined statistics:
  - t_stat: Uses NaN (not 0.0) when SE is non-finite or zero
  - p_value and CI: Also NaN when t_stat is NaN
  - avg_se: Checked for finiteness before computing avg_t_stat
  - **Note**: Defensive enhancement matching CallawaySantAnna NaN convention
- Treatment reversal: warns if any unit transitions from treated to untreated
  (non-absorbing treatment violates the simultaneous adoption assumption)
- Time-varying treatment (D_it): warns when `unit` parameter is provided and
  within-unit treatment variation is detected. Advises creating an ever-treated
  indicator. Without ever-treated D_i, pre-period interaction coefficients are
  unidentified.
- Pre-test of parallel trends: joint F-test on pre-treatment δ_e coefficients.
  Low power in pre-test does not validate parallel trends (Roth 2022).

**Reference implementation(s):**
- R: `fixest::feols(y ~ i(time, treatment, ref=ref_period) | unit + time, data, cluster=~unit)`
  or equivalently `feols(y ~ i(event_time, ref=-1) | unit + time, data, cluster=~unit)`
- Stata: `reghdfe y ib(-1).event_time#1.treatment, absorb(unit time) cluster(unit)`

**Requirements checklist:**

- [x] Event-time indicators for ALL periods (pre and post), not just post-treatment
- [x] Reference period coefficient is zero (normalized by omission from design matrix)
- [x] Pre-period coefficients available for parallel trends assessment
- [ ] Default cluster-robust SE at unit level (currently HC1; cluster-robust via `cluster` param)
- [ ] Supports unit and time FE via absorption
- [ ] Endpoint binning for distant event times
- [x] Average ATT correctly accounts for covariance between period effects
- [x] Returns PeriodEffect objects with confidence intervals
- [x] Supports both balanced and unbalanced panels

## TwoWayFixedEffects

**Primary source:** Panel data econometrics
- Wooldridge, J.M. (2010). *Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data*, 2nd ed. MIT Press, Chapter 10.

**Key implementation requirements:**

*Assumption checks / warnings:*
- **Staggered treatment warning**: If treatment timing varies across units, warns about potential bias from negative weights (Goodman-Bacon 2021, de Chaisemartin & D'Haultfœuille 2020)
- Requires sufficient within-unit and within-time variation
- Warns if any fixed effect is perfectly collinear with treatment

*Estimator equation (as implemented):*
```
Y_it = α_i + γ_t + τ(D_it) + X'β + ε_it
```
Estimated via within-transformation (demeaning):
```
Ỹ_it = τD̃_it + X̃'β + ε̃_it
```
where tildes denote demeaned variables.

**Note:** The interaction term `D_i × Post_t` is within-transformed (demeaned) alongside the
outcome and covariates before regression. This is required by the Frisch-Waugh-Lovell theorem:
all regressors must be projected out of the same fixed effects space as the dependent variable.
This matches the behavior of R's `fixest::feols()` with absorbed FE.

*Standard errors:*
- Default: Cluster-robust at unit level (accounts for serial correlation)
- Degrees of freedom adjusted for absorbed fixed effects: `df_adjustment = n_units + n_times - 2`

*Edge cases:*
- Singleton units/periods are automatically dropped
- Treatment perfectly collinear with FE raises error with informative message listing dropped columns
- Covariate collinearity emits warning but estimation continues (ATT still identified)
- Rank-deficient design matrix: warns and sets NA for dropped coefficients (R-style, matches `lm()`)
- Unbalanced panels handled via proper demeaning
- Multi-period `time` parameter: only binary (0/1) post indicator is recommended; multi-period values
  produce `treated × period_number` rather than `treated × post_indicator`. A `UserWarning` is
  emitted when `time` has >2 unique values, advising users to create a binary post column.
  Non-{0,1} binary time (e.g., {2020, 2021}) also emits a warning, though the ATT is mathematically
  correct — the within-transformation absorbs the scaling.
- Staggered warning limitation: requires `time` to have actual period values (not binary 0/1)
  so that different cohort first-treatment times can be distinguished. With binary `time="post"`,
  all treated units appear to start at `time=1`, making staggering undetectable. Users with
  staggered designs should use `decompose()` or `CallawaySantAnna` directly.

**Reference implementation(s):**
- R: `fixest::feols(y ~ treat:post | unit + post, data, cluster = ~unit)`
- Stata: `reghdfe y treat, absorb(unit time) cluster(unit)`

**Requirements checklist:**
- [ ] Staggered adoption detection warning (only fires when `time` has >2 unique values; with binary `time`, staggering is undetectable)
- [x] Multi-period time warning (fires when `time` has >2 unique values)
- [x] Auto-clusters standard errors at unit level
- [x] `decompose()` method returns BaconDecompositionResults
- [x] Within-transformation correctly handles unbalanced panels
- [x] Non-{0,1} binary time warning (fires when time has 2 unique values not in {0,1})
- [x] ATT invariance to time encoding (verified by test)

# Modern Staggered Estimators

## CallawaySantAnna

**Primary source:** [Callaway, B., & Sant'Anna, P.H.C. (2021). Difference-in-Differences with multiple time periods. *Journal of Econometrics*, 225(2), 200-230.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.12.001)

**Key implementation requirements:**

*Assumption checks / warnings:*
- Requires never-treated units as comparison group (identified by `first_treat=0` or `never_treated=True`)
- Warns if no never-treated units exist (suggests alternative comparison strategies)
- Limited pre-treatment periods reduce ability to test parallel trends
- **Note:** The analytical SE paths call `_safe_inv()` on the propensity-score Hessian (`H_psi`) and outcome-regression bread (`X'WX`) across every `(g, t)` cell. When these matrices are rank deficient, `np.linalg.solve` raises `LinAlgError` and `_safe_inv()` falls back to `np.linalg.lstsq`. Previously silent; now `fit()` emits ONE aggregate `UserWarning` at the end of the fit reporting the number of fallbacks and the max condition number, so a rank-deficient analytical SE path can't quietly ship degraded standard errors. Sibling of axis-A finding #17 in the Phase 2 silent-failures audit.

*Estimator equation (as implemented):*

Group-time average treatment effect:
```
ATT(g,t) = E[Y_t - Y_{g-1} | G_g=1] - E[Y_t - Y_{g-1} | C=1]
```
where G_g=1 indicates units first treated in period g, and C=1 indicates never-treated.

*Note:* This equation uses g-1 as the base period, which applies to post-treatment effects (t ≥ g) and `base_period="universal"`. With `base_period="varying"` (default), pre-treatment effects use t-1 as base for consecutive comparisons (see Base period selection in Edge cases).

With covariates (doubly robust):
```
ATT(g,t) = E[((G_g - p̂_g(X))/(1-p̂_g(X))) × (Y_t - Y_{g-1} - m̂_{0,g,t}(X) + m̂_{0,g,g-1}(X))] / E[G_g]
```

Aggregations:
- Simple: `ATT = Σ_{g,t} w_{g,t} × ATT(g,t)` weighted by group size
- Event-study: `ATT(e) = Σ_g w_g × ATT(g, g+e)` for event-time e
- Group: `ATT(g) = Σ_t ATT(g,t) / T_g` average over post-periods

*Standard errors:*
- Default: Analytical (influence function-based)
- All aggregation SEs (simple, event study) include the weight influence function (WIF)
  adjustment, matching R's `did::aggte()`. The WIF accounts for uncertainty in estimating
  group-size aggregation weights. Group aggregation uses equal time weights (deterministic),
  so WIF is zero.
- Bootstrap: Multiplier bootstrap with Rademacher, Mammen, or Webb weights. Bootstrap
  perturbs the combined influence function (standard IF + WIF) directly, not just fixed-weight
  re-aggregation. This correctly propagates weight estimation uncertainty.
- Block structure preserves within-unit correlation
- Simultaneous confidence bands (`cband=True`, default): Uses sup-t bootstrap to compute
  a uniform critical value across event times, controlling family-wise error rate. Matches
  R's `did::aggte(..., cband=TRUE)` default. Requires `n_bootstrap > 0`.

*Bootstrap weight distributions:*

The multiplier bootstrap uses random weights w_i with E[w]=0 and Var(w)=1:

| Weight Type | Values | Probabilities | Properties |
|-------------|--------|---------------|------------|
| Rademacher | ±1 | 1/2 each | Simplest; E[w³]=0 |
| Mammen | -(√5-1)/2, (√5+1)/2 | (√5+1)/(2√5), (√5-1)/(2√5) | E[w³]=1; better for skewed data |
| Webb | ±√(3/2), ±1, ±√(1/2) | 1/6 each | 6-point; recommended for few clusters |

**Webb distribution details:**
- Values: {-√(3/2), -1, -√(1/2), √(1/2), 1, √(3/2)} ≈ {-1.225, -1, -0.707, 0.707, 1, 1.225}
- Equal probabilities (1/6 each) giving E[w]=0, Var(w)=1
- Matches R's `did` package implementation
- **Verification**: Implementation matches `fwildclusterboot` R package
  ([C++ source](https://github.com/s3alfisc/fwildclusterboot/blob/master/src/wildboottest.cpp))
  which uses identical `sqrt(1.5)`, `1`, `sqrt(0.5)` values with equal 1/6 probabilities.
  Some documentation shows simplified values (±1.5, ±1, ±0.5) but actual implementations
  use square root values to achieve unit variance.

  Queen's Economics Department Working Paper No. 1315. (Updated from Webb 2014)

*Edge cases:*
- Groups with single observation: included but may have high variance
- Missing group-time cells: omitted from `group_time_effects` with a consolidated warning listing skip reasons and counts
  - **Note:** Non-estimable cells (missing base/post period, zero treated/control, insufficient data) are omitted rather than stored as NaN. A consolidated UserWarning is emitted from `fit()` across all estimation paths. R's `did` package also omits these cells from `aggte()` results.
  - **Note:** When `balance_e` is specified, cohorts with NaN effects at the anchor horizon are excluded from the balanced panel
- Anticipation: `anticipation` parameter shifts reference period
  - Group aggregation includes periods t >= g - anticipation (not just t >= g)
  - Both analytical SE and bootstrap SE aggregation respect anticipation
  - Not-yet-treated + anticipation: control mask uses `G > max(t, base_period) + anticipation`
    to exclude cohorts treated at either the evaluation period or the base period.
    This prevents control contamination when `base_period="universal"` and the base
    period is later than the evaluation period (e.g., pre-treatment ATT with universal base)
- Rank-deficient design matrix (covariate collinearity):
  - Detection: Pivoted QR decomposition with tolerance `1e-07` (R's `qr()` default)
  - Handling: Warns and drops linearly dependent columns, sets NA for dropped coefficients (R-style, matches `lm()`)
  - Parameter: `rank_deficient_action` controls behavior: "warn" (default), "error", or "silent"
- Non-finite inference values:
  - Analytic SE: Returns NaN to signal invalid inference (not biased via zeroing)
  - Bootstrap: Drops non-finite samples, warns, and adjusts p-value floor accordingly. SE, CI, and p-value are all NaN if the original point estimate is non-finite, SE is non-finite or zero (e.g., n_valid=1 with ddof=1, or identical samples)
  - Threshold: Returns NaN if <50% of bootstrap samples are valid
  - Per-effect t_stat: Uses NaN (not 0.0) when SE is non-finite or zero (consistent with overall_t_stat)
  - **Note**: This is a defensive enhancement over reference implementations (R's `did::att_gt`, Stata's `csdid`) which may error or produce unhandled inf/nan in edge cases without informative warnings
- No post-treatment effects (all treatment occurs after data ends):
  - Overall ATT set to NaN (no post-treatment periods to aggregate)
  - All overall inference fields (SE, t-stat, p-value, CI) also set to NaN
  - Warning emitted: "No post-treatment effects for aggregation"
  - Individual pre-treatment ATT(g,t) are computed (for parallel trends assessment)
  - Bootstrap runs for per-effect SEs even without post-treatment; only overall statistics are NaN
  - **Principle**: NaN propagates consistently through overall inference fields; pre-treatment effects get full bootstrap inference
- Aggregated t_stat (event-study, group-level):
  - Uses NaN when SE is non-finite or zero (matches per-effect and overall t_stat behavior)
  - Previous behavior (0.0 default) was inconsistent and misleading
- Base period selection (`base_period` parameter):
  - "varying" (default): Pre-treatment uses t-1 as base (consecutive comparisons).
    Post-treatment uses long differences from g-1-anticipation. The parallel trends
    assumption for treatment effects is about long-run trends, but pre-treatment tests
    only check consecutive periods.
  - "universal": ALL effects (pre and post) are long differences from g-1-anticipation.
    The parallel trends assumption is about long-run trends. Pre-treatment coefficients
    test cumulative divergence from the base period.
  - Both produce identical post-treatment ATT(g,t); differ only pre-treatment
  - `anticipation` shifts the base period to g-1-anticipation, which moves it further
    from treatment and strengthens the parallel trends assumption.
  - Matches R `did::att_gt()` base_period parameter
  - **Event study output**: With "universal", includes reference period (e=-1-anticipation)
    with effect=0, se=NaN, conf_int=(NaN, NaN). Inference fields are NaN since this is
    a normalization constraint, not an estimated effect. Only added when real effects exist.
- Base period interaction with Sun-Abraham comparison:
  - CS with `base_period="varying"` produces different pre-treatment estimates than SA
  - This is expected: CS uses consecutive comparisons, SA uses fixed reference (e=-1-anticipation)
  - Use `base_period="universal"` for methodologically comparable pre-treatment effects
  - Post-treatment effects match regardless of base_period setting
- Propensity score estimation:
  - Algorithm: IRLS (Fisher scoring), matching R's `glm(family=binomial)` default
  - **Note:** Uses IRLS (Fisher scoring) for propensity score estimation, consistent
    with R's `did::att_gt()` which uses `glm(family=binomial)` internally
  - Near-separation detection: Warns when predicted probabilities are within 1e-5
    of 0 or 1, or when IRLS fails to converge
  - Trimming: Propensity scores clipped to `[pscore_trim, 1-pscore_trim]` (default
    0.01) before weight computation. Warning emitted when scores are trimmed.
  - **Events Per Variable (EPV) diagnostics:** Per-cohort EPV =
    min(n_treated, n_control) / n_covariates checked before IRLS.
    Default threshold: 10 (Peduzzi et al. 1996). Warns when EPV < threshold;
    errors when `rank_deficient_action="error"`. Pre-estimation check via
    `diagnose_propensity()`. Results stored in `results.epv_diagnostics`.
  - Fallback: Controlled by `pscore_fallback` parameter (default `"error"`).
    If IRLS fails entirely (LinAlgError/ValueError) and `pscore_fallback="error"`,
    the error is raised. If `pscore_fallback="unconditional"`, falls back to
    unconditional propensity score with warning. For IPW, this effectively
    drops all covariates. For DR, the propensity model is unconditional but
    the outcome-regression component still uses covariates.
  - **Note:** `pscore_fallback` default changed from unconditional to error.
    Set `pscore_fallback="unconditional"` for legacy behavior.
  - **Note:** When `pscore_fallback="unconditional"` triggers, the propensity-
    score influence function correction is skipped (constant pscore has zero
    estimation uncertainty). SEs reflect outcome-model uncertainty only.
- Control group with `control_group="not_yet_treated"`:
  - Always excludes cohort g from controls when computing ATT(g,t)
  - This applies to both pre-treatment (t < g) and post-treatment (t >= g) periods
  - For pre-treatment periods: even though cohort g hasn't been treated yet at time t, they are the treated group for this ATT(g,t) and cannot serve as their own controls
  - Control mask: `never_treated OR (first_treat > max(t, base_period) + anticipation AND first_treat != g)`
  - The `max(t, base_period)` ensures controls are untreated at both the evaluation period
    and the base period, preventing contamination when `base_period="universal"` uses
    a base period later than `t` (matching R's `did::att_gt()`)
  - Does not require never-treated units: when all units are eventually treated,
    not-yet-treated cohorts serve as controls for each other (requires ≥2 cohorts)
- **Note:** CallawaySantAnna survey support: weights, strata, PSU, and FPC are all supported for all estimation methods (reg, ipw, dr) with or without covariates. Analytical (`n_bootstrap=0`): aggregated SEs use design-based variance via `compute_survey_if_variance()`. Bootstrap (`n_bootstrap>0`): PSU-level multiplier weights replace analytical SEs for aggregated quantities. IPW and DR with covariates use DRDID panel nuisance IF corrections (Phase 7a: PS IF correction via survey-weighted Hessian/score, OR IF correction via WLS bread and gradient; Sant'Anna & Zhao 2020, Theorem 3.1). Survey weights compose with IPW weights multiplicatively. WIF in aggregation matches R's did::wif() formula. Per-unit survey weights are extracted via `groupby(unit).first()` from the panel-normalized pweight array; on unbalanced panels the pweight normalization (`w * n_obs / sum(w)`) preserves relative unit weights since all IF/WIF formulas use weight ratios (`sw_i / sum(sw)`) where the normalization constant cancels. Scale-invariance tests pass on both balanced and unbalanced panels.
- **Note (deviation from R):** Panel DR control augmentation is normalized by treated mass (`sw_t_sum` or `n_t`) rather than control IPW mass (`sum(w_cont)`). R's `DRDID::drdid_panel` uses `mean(w.cont)` as the control normalizer. Both are consistent asymptotically (under correct model specification, `E[w_cont] = E[D]` so the normalizers converge), but they differ in finite samples when IPW reweighting doesn't perfectly balance. The treated-mass normalization is simpler and matches the `did::att_gt` convention where ATT is defined per treated unit. Aligning to `DRDID::drdid_panel`'s exact `w.cont` normalization is deferred.
- **Note:** PS nuisance IF corrections follow DRDID's M-estimation convention: `asy_lin_rep_psi` is computed on O(1) psi scale (matching R's `asy.lin.rep.ps = score %*% Hessian.ps`), then the correction `asy_lin_rep_psi @ M2` is converted to the library's O(1/n) phi convention via a single `/n` division. OR corrections use the same phi-scale pattern via `solve(X'WX)` (unnormalized Hessian).
- **Note (deviation from R):** CallawaySantAnna survey reg+covariates per-cell SE uses a conservative plug-in IF based on WLS residuals. The treated IF is `inf_treated_i = (sw_i/sum(sw_treated)) * (resid_i - ATT)` (normalized by treated weight sum, matching unweighted `(resid-ATT)/n_t`). The control IF is `inf_control_i = -(sw_i/sum(sw_control)) * wls_resid_i` (normalized by control weight sum, matching unweighted `-resid/n_c`). SE is computed as `sqrt(sum(sw_t_norm * (resid_t - ATT)^2) + sum(sw_c_norm * resid_c^2))`, the weighted analogue of the unweighted `sqrt(var_t/n_t + var_c/n_c)`. This omits the semiparametrically efficient nuisance correction from DRDID's `reg_did_panel` — WLS residuals are orthogonal to the weighted design matrix by construction, so the first-order IF term is asymptotically valid but may be conservative. SEs pass weight-scale-invariance tests. The efficient DRDID correction is deferred to future work.
- **Note (deviation from R):** Per-cell ATT(g,t) SEs under survey weights use influence-function-based variance (matching R's `did::att_gt` analytical SE path) rather than full Taylor-series linearization. When strata/PSU/FPC are present, analytical aggregated SEs (`n_bootstrap=0`) use `compute_survey_if_variance()` on the combined IF/WIF; bootstrap aggregated SEs (`n_bootstrap>0`) use PSU-level multiplier weights.

- **Note:** Repeated cross-sections (`panel=False`, Phase 7b): supports surveys like BRFSS, ACS annual, and CPS monthly where units are not followed over time. Uses cross-sectional DRDID (Sant'Anna & Zhao 2020, Section 4): `reg` matches `DRDID::reg_did_rc` (Eq 2.2), `dr` matches `DRDID::drdid_rc` (locally efficient, Eq 3.3+3.4 with 4 OLS fits), `ipw` matches `DRDID::std_ipw_did_rc`. Per-observation influence functions instead of per-unit. All three estimation methods support covariates and survey weights.
- **Note:** Panel and RCS influence functions use the library-wide `phi_i = psi_i / n` convention (SE = `sqrt(sum(phi^2))`, algebraically equivalent to R's `sd(psi)*sqrt(n-1)/n`). Leading IF terms are computed on psi scale and divided by n; PS nuisance corrections are computed on psi scale (`score @ solve(Hessian)`) with a single `/n` conversion to phi.
- **Note:** Non-survey DR path also includes nuisance IF corrections (PS + OR), matching the survey path structure (Phase 7a). Previously used plug-in IF only.

**Reference implementation(s):**
- R: `did::att_gt()` (Callaway & Sant'Anna's official package)
- Stata: `csdid`

**Requirements checklist:**
- [ ] Requires never-treated units when `control_group="never_treated"` (default); not required for `"not_yet_treated"`

NBER Working Paper 29873.](https://www.nber.org/papers/w29873) — Web Appendix Section 3.7.3 contains the cohort-recentered plug-in variance formula implemented here.

**Phase 1-2 scope:** Ships the contemporaneous-switch estimator `DID_M` (= `DID_1` at horizon `l = 1`) from the AER 2020 paper **plus** the full multi-horizon event study `DID_l` for `l = 1..L_max` from the dynamic companion paper. Phase 2 adds: per-group `DID_{g,l}` building block (Equation 3), dynamic placebos `DID^{pl}_l`, normalized estimator `DID^n_l`, cost-benefit aggregate `delta`, sup-t simultaneous confidence bands, and `plot_event_study()` integration. Phase 3 adds covariate adjustment (`DID^X`), group-specific linear trends (`DID^{fd}`), state-set-specific trends, and HonestDiD integration. Survey design supports pweight with strata/PSU/FPC via Taylor Series Linearization (analytical) or replicate-weight variance (BRR/Fay/JK1/JKn/SDR) across all IF sites, plus opt-in PSU-level Hall-Mammen wild bootstrap via `n_bootstrap > 0` (see the full checklist + Notes below for the contract). **This is the only modern staggered estimator in the library that handles non-absorbing (reversible) treatments** - treatment can switch on AND off over time, making it the natural fit for marketing campaigns, seasonal promotions, on/off policy cycles.

**Key implementation requirements:**

*Assumption checks / warnings:*
- **Note:** Treatment supports both binary `{0, 1}` and non-binary (ordinal or continuous) values. Non-binary treatment requires `L_max >= 1` because the per-period DID path uses binary joiner/leaver categorization; the multi-horizon per-group path (`DID_{g,l}`) handles non-binary correctly. The paper's setup (Section 2 of the dynamic companion) defines treatment as a general variable `D_{g,t}` - the binary case is a special case. Under non-binary treatment: baselines are `D_{g,1}` (float), control pools match on exact baseline value, cohorts are defined by `(D_{g,1}, F_g, S_g)` where `S_g = sign(D_{g,F_g} - D_{g,1})`, and groups with different dose magnitudes but same baseline/timing are pooled within a cohort for variance recentering.
- NaN values in `treatment` or `outcome` columns raise `ValueError` early in `fit()` (no silent drops).
- Treatment must be constant within each `(g, t)` cell. Within-cell-varying treatment (cell min != cell max) raises `ValueError`. Pre-aggregate your data to constant cell-level treatment before fitting. Fuzzy DiD is deferred to a separate dCDH 2018 paper.
- **Note:** Multi-switch groups (those with more than one treatment-change period) are dropped before estimation when `drop_larger_lower=True` (the default, matching R `DIDmultiplegtDYN`). For binary treatment, >1 change means a reversal (e.g., 0->1->0). For non-binary, >1 change includes both reversals (0->2->1) and monotone multi-step paths (0->1->2); both are dropped because the per-group `DID_{g,l}` building block attributes the full outcome change from `F_g-1` to `F_g-1+l` to the first treatment change, and a second change would confound that attribution. A single jump of any magnitude (0->3->3->3) has 1 change period and is kept. Each drop emits a warning with the count and example group IDs.
- Singleton-baseline groups — groups whose `D_{g,1}` value is unique in the post-drop dataset — are excluded from the **variance computation only** (per footnote 15 of the dynamic paper, they have no cohort peer). They are **retained** in the point-estimate sample as period-based stable controls. Each emits a warning. See the singleton-baseline Note below.
- Never-switching groups (`S_g = 0`) participate in the variance computation when they serve as stable controls under the full influence function. The `n_groups_dropped_never_switching` results field is reported for backwards compatibility but the count no longer represents an actual exclusion.
- **Balanced-baseline panel required (deviation from R `DIDmultiplegtDYN`).** Every group must have an observation at the **first global period** (the panel's earliest time value); groups missing this baseline raise `ValueError` with the offending group IDs. Groups with **interior period gaps** (missing observations between their first and last observed period) are dropped with a `UserWarning`. **Terminal missingness** (groups observed at the baseline but missing one or more *later* periods) is **retained**: the group contributes from its observed periods only, masked out of the missing transitions by the per-period `present = (N_mat[:, t] > 0) & (N_mat[:, t-1] > 0)` guard. See the ragged-panel deviation Note below.
- **Period-index semantics.** The estimator operates on **sorted period indices**, not calendar dates. Per-period DIDs use `Y_{g,t} - Y_{g,t-1}` where `t-1` is the *previous observed period in the sorted panel*, not the previous calendar unit. A panel with periods `[2000, 2001, 2003]` (missing year 2002 for ALL groups) is treated as a valid 3-period panel where 2003 is the immediate successor of 2001. The estimator does NOT validate that periods are evenly spaced or that calendar gaps have been imputed. This matches the AER 2020 paper's Theorem 3, which defines transition sets by adjacent sorted periods without assuming calendar regularity, and is consistent with R `DIDmultiplegtDYN`'s behavior. If your data has calendar gaps that should be treated as missing periods rather than adjacent transitions, insert placeholder rows for the missing periods with the group's lagged treatment value and a reasonable imputed outcome (e.g., the group's last observed outcome), so the cell-aggregation step treats the gap as a stable-treatment period rather than a missing one. The validator rejects NaN in outcome and treatment columns, so placeholders must have finite values.
- Per-period Assumption 11 violations (joiners exist but no stable-untreated controls in some period, or leavers exist but no stable-treated controls) trigger zero-retention behavior with a consolidated warning. See the A11 Note below.

*Estimator equations (Theorem 3 of AER 2020 / Section 3.7.2 of the dynamic paper):*

Per-period DiDs at each switching period `t >= 2`:

```
DID_{+,t} = (1/N_{1,0,t}) * sum_{g in joiners(t)} (Y_{g,t} - Y_{g,t-1})
          - (1/N_{0,0,t}) * sum_{g in stable_0(t)} (Y_{g,t} - Y_{g,t-1})

DID_{-,t} = (1/N_{1,1,t}) * sum_{g in stable_1(t)} (Y_{g,t} - Y_{g,t-1})
          - (1/N_{0,1,t}) * sum_{g in leavers(t)} (Y_{g,t} - Y_{g,t-1})
```

where `joiners(t)` are groups switching from `D_{g,t-1}=0` to `D_{g,t}=1`, `leavers(t)` are groups switching `1->0`, `stable_0(t)` are groups with `D_{g,t-1}=D_{g,t}=0`, and `stable_1(t)` are groups with `D_{g,t-1}=D_{g,t}=1`. **`N_{a,b,t}` is the COUNT of `(g, t)` cells in each transition state — not the sum of within-cell observation counts.** Each `(g, t)` cell contributes once to its transition's count regardless of how many original observations fed into the cell mean. The cell mean `Y_{g,t}` is computed at the cell-aggregation step via `groupby([group, time]).agg(y_gt=mean)`; the per-period DIDs use these cell means directly without further sample-size weighting. This matches the AER 2020 paper's cell-level notation for `N_{a,b,t}` as a count of transition-state cells (the paper can also be read as using observation sums; the equal-cell interpretation is the one implemented here). **Note (deviation from R `DIDmultiplegtDYN`):** On individual-level inputs with uneven `(group, time)` cell sizes, Python gives each cell **equal weight** (paper-literal cell-count weighting). R `DIDmultiplegtDYN`, absent an explicit weight variable, weights estimation by the number of observations in each cell (cell-size weighting). The two agree exactly on cell-aggregated input where every cell has the same number of observations. The Python parity tests in `tests/test_chaisemartin_dhaultfoeuille_parity.py` use the `generate_reversible_did_data()` generator, which produces exactly one observation per cell, so parity holds. The regression test `test_cell_count_weighting_unbalanced_input` in `tests/test_chaisemartin_dhaultfoeuille.py` explicitly pins the equal-cell contract.

Aggregate `DID_M`:

```
N_S   = sum_{t>=2} (N_{1,0,t} + N_{0,1,t})
DID_M = (1/N_S) * sum_{t>=2} (N_{1,0,t} * DID_{+,t} + N_{0,1,t} * DID_{-,t})
```

Joiners-only and leavers-only views (each weighted by its own switcher count):

```
DID_+ = sum_{t>=2} (N_{1,0,t} / sum_{t} N_{1,0,t}) * DID_{+,t}
DID_- = sum_{t>=2} (N_{0,1,t} / sum_{t} N_{0,1,t}) * DID_{-,t}
```

Single-lag placebo (AER 2020 placebo specification, same section as Theorem 3) — applies the same Theorem 3 logic to `Y_{g,t-1} - Y_{g,t-2}` on cells with 3-period histories:

```
DID_M^pl = (1/N_S^pl) * sum_{t>=3} (
              N_{1,0,t} * [(Y_{g,t-1} - Y_{g,t-2})_{joiners} - ...] +
              N_{0,1,t} * [(Y_{g,t-1} - Y_{g,t-2})_{stable_1} - ...]
          )
```

*Phase 2: Multi-horizon event study (Equation 3 and 5 of the dynamic companion paper):*

When `L_max >= 1`, the estimator computes the per-group building block `DID_{g,l}` and the aggregate `DID_l` for each horizon. When `L_max=1`, `overall_att` holds `DID_1` (the per-group estimand, not the per-period `DID_M`). When `L_max >= 2`, `overall_att` holds the cost-benefit delta. When `L_max=None`, the per-period `DID_M` path is used:

```
DID_{g,l} = Y_{g, F_g-1+l} - Y_{g, F_g-1}
            - (1/N^g_{F_g-1+l}) * sum_{g': same baseline, F_{g'}>F_g-1+l}
                (Y_{g', F_g-1+l} - Y_{g', F_g-1})

DID_l     = (1/N_l) * sum_{g: F_g-1+l <= T_g} S_g * DID_{g,l}
```

Normalized estimator `DID^n_l = DID_l / delta^D_l` where `delta^D_l = (1/N_l) * sum |delta^D_{g,l}|` and `delta^D_{g,l} = sum_{k=0}^{l-1} (D_{g,F_g+k} - D_{g,1})`. For binary treatment: `DID^n_l = DID_l / l`.

Cost-benefit aggregate `delta = sum_l w_l * DID_l` (Lemma 4) where `w_l` are non-negative weights reflecting the cumulative dose at each horizon. When `L_max > 1`, `overall_att` holds this delta.

Dynamic placebos `DID^{pl}_l` look backward from each group's reference period, with a dual eligibility condition: `F_g - 1 - l >= 1` AND `F_g - 1 + l <= T_g`.

- **Note (Phase 2 `DID_1` vs Phase 1 `DID_M`):** When `L_max >= 2`, `event_study_effects[1]` uses the per-group `DID_{g,1}` building block (Equation 3 of the dynamic paper) with cohort-based controls, which may differ slightly from the Phase 1 `DID_M` value (Theorem 3 of AER 2020 with period-based stable-control sets). The Phase 1 `DID_M` value remains accessible via `fit(..., L_max=None).overall_att`. The difference arises because the per-group path conditions on baseline treatment `D_{g,1}` when selecting controls, while the per-period path does not. On pure-direction panels (all joiners or all leavers) the two agree; on mixed-direction panels they can differ by O(1%). This is the same period-vs-cohort control-set deviation documented in the Phase 1 Note above, extended to the `l=1` event-study entry.

- **Note (Phase 2 equal-cell weighting, deviation from R `DIDmultiplegtDYN`):** The Phase 1 equal-cell weighting contract carries forward to all Phase 2 estimands (`DID_l`, `DID^{pl}_l`, `DID^n_l`, `delta`). Each `(g, t)` cell contributes equally regardless of within-cell observation count. On individual-level inputs with uneven cell sizes, this produces a different estimand than R `DIDmultiplegtDYN` which weights by cell size. The parity tests use one-observation-per-cell generators so parity holds. See the Phase 1 weighting Note above for the full rationale.

- **Note (Phase 2 `<50%` switcher warning):** When fewer than 50% of the l=1 switchers contribute at a far horizon l, `fit()` emits a `UserWarning`. The paper recommends not reporting such horizons (Favara-Imbs application, footnote 14).

- **Note (Phase 2 Assumption 7 and cost-benefit delta):** Assumption 7 (`D_{g,t} >= D_{g,1}`) is required for the single-sign cost-benefit interpretation. When leavers are present (binary: 1->0 groups violate Assumption 7), the estimator emits a `UserWarning` and provides `delta_joiners` / `delta_leavers` separately on `results.cost_benefit_delta`.

- **Note (Phase 2 cost-benefit delta SE):** When `L_max >= 2`, `overall_att` holds the cost-benefit `delta`. Its SE is computed via the delta method from per-horizon SEs: `SE(delta) = sqrt(sum w_l^2 * SE(DID_l)^2)`, treating horizons as independent (conservative under Assumption 8). When bootstrap is enabled, per-horizon bootstrap SEs flow through the delta-method formula, so `overall_se` reflects bootstrap-derived per-horizon uncertainty but the delta aggregation itself uses normal-theory (not bootstrap percentile). This is an intentional exception to the general bootstrap-inference-surface contract: `overall_p_value` and `overall_conf_int` for `delta` use `safe_inference(delta, delta_se)`, not percentile bootstrap, because the delta is a derived aggregate rather than a directly bootstrapped estimand.

- **Note (dynamic placebo SE - library extension):** Dynamic placebos `DID^{pl}_l` (negative horizons in `placebo_event_study`) now have analytical SE and bootstrap SE when `L_max >= 1`. The placebo IF uses the same cohort-recentered structure as positive horizons, applied to backward outcome differences `Y_{g, F_g-1-l} - Y_{g, F_g-1}` with the dual-eligibility control pool (forward + backward observation required). The paper's Theorem 1 variance result is stated for `DID_l`, not `DID^{pl}_l` - this extension applies the same IF/variance structure to the placebo estimand as a library enhancement. The single-period placebo `DID_M^pl` (`L_max=None`) retains NaN SE because the per-period aggregation path has no IF derivation.

*Standard errors (Web Appendix Section 3.7.3 of the dynamic companion paper):*

Default: cohort-recentered analytical plug-in variance, evaluated at horizon `l = 1`. Cohorts are defined by the triple `(D_{g,1}, F_g, S_g)` (baseline treatment, first-switch period, switch direction). Each group's per-period role weights (joiner, stable_0, leaver, stable_1) sum to a per-group `U^G_g` value via the full `Lambda^G_{g,l=1}` weight vector from Section 3.7.2 of the dynamic paper:

```
N_S * DID_M = sum_t [
      sum_{g in joiners(t)}  (Y_{g,t} - Y_{g,t-1})
    - (N_{1,0,t} / N_{0,0,t}) * sum_{g in stable_0(t)} (Y_{g,t} - Y_{g,t-1})
    + (N_{0,1,t} / N_{1,1,t}) * sum_{g in stable_1(t)} (Y_{g,t} - Y_{g,t-1})
    - sum_{g in leavers(t)}  (Y_{g,t} - Y_{g,t-1})
]
```

Reading off the coefficient on each `(Y_{g,t} - Y_{g,t-1})` gives the per-cell role weight, which sums across periods to:

```
U^G_g     = sum_t lambda^G_{g,t} * (Y_{g,t} - Y_{g,t-1})    # full IF
U_bar_k   = (1/|C_k|) * sum_{g in C_k} U^G_g                # cohort-conditional mean
sigma_hat^2 = sum_g (U^G_g - U_bar_{cohort(g)})^2 / N_l
SE         = sqrt(sigma_hat^2 / N_l)
```

Each switching group typically contributes from MULTIPLE periods: its own switch period plus every period where it serves as a stable control for another cohort's switch. Never-switching groups can also have non-zero `U^G_g` when they serve as stable controls. Singleton-baseline groups (footnote 15 of dynamic paper) are excluded from this sum because they have no cohort peer.

The cohort recentering is critical: subtracting cohort-conditional means is **not** the same as subtracting a single grand mean. The implementation has a dedicated regression test (`test_cohort_recentering_not_grand_mean`) that computes both formulas on a designed DGP and asserts they differ materially.

Alternative: Multiplier bootstrap clustered at group via the `n_bootstrap` parameter. Available weight distributions: `"rademacher"` (default), `"mammen"`, `"webb"`. The bootstrap is a library extension beyond the original papers and is provided for consistency with `CallawaySantAnna` / `ImputationDiD` / `TwoStageDiD`.

*Edge cases:*
- **No switchers in data** (after filtering): raises `ValueError` with a clear message indicating which filters dropped which groups.
- **No joiners** (only leavers in data): `joiners_available = False`, all `joiners_*` fields are `NaN`. Symmetric for `leavers_available = False`.
- **`T < 3`**: placebo cannot be computed; `placebo_available = False` with a `UserWarning`.
- **NaN inference**: `safe_inference()` produces NaN-consistent inference fields (t-stat, p-value, conf int) when SE is non-finite or zero. `assert_nan_inference()` is used in tests to enforce consistency.
- **TWFE diagnostic with zero denominator**: when `sum(d_gt - d_bar)^2 == 0` (e.g., all cells have identical treatment), the diagnostic returns NaN for `beta_fe` and `sigma_fe` with a `UserWarning`. The diagnostic is non-fatal — it does not block the main estimation.
- **`placebo=False`** (gating): the results object still exposes `placebo_*` fields, but with `NaN` values and `placebo_available = False`. This keeps the API surface stable.

- **Note:** The analytical CI is **conservative** under Assumption 8 (independent groups) of the dynamic companion paper, and exact only under iid sampling. This is documented as a deliberate deviation from "default nominal coverage". The bootstrap CI uses the same conservative weighting and is provided for users who want a non-asymptotic alternative.

- **Note (deviation from R DIDmultiplegtDYN - SE normalization):** The analytical SE is ~4% smaller than R `did_multiplegt_dyn` on identical data. This is a normalization difference, not a bug. Python implements the paper's Section 3.7.3 plug-in formula verbatim: `SE = sigma-hat / sqrt(N_l)` where `sigma-hat^2 = (1/N_l) * sum_g U^{G,2}_{g,l} - sum_k (#C_k^G / N_l) * U-bar_k^2` and `N_l` is the number of eligible switcher groups at horizon `l`. R normalizes the influence function by `G` (total number of groups including never-switchers and stable controls) and computes `SE = sqrt(sum(U_R^2)) / G`. Both converge to the same asymptotic variance as `G -> infinity`. In finite samples R's formula produces slightly larger (more conservative) SEs because the `G`-normalization interacts with cohort recentering differently than the paper's `N_l`-normalization. Since the paper's formula is already an upper bound on the true variance (Eq 54, Jensen's inequality under Assumption 8), Python's tighter SE remains conservative. The observed gap is consistent across horizons and scenarios (~3.5-5.1%), deterministic on identical data, and does not involve any randomization.

- **Note:** Placebo SE is `NaN` for the single-period `DID_M^pl` (`L_max=None`). Multi-horizon placebos (`L_max >= 1`) have valid analytical SE and bootstrap SE via the placebo IF (see the dynamic placebo SE Note above).

- **Note:** When every variance-eligible group forms its own `(D_{g,1}, F_g, S_g)` cohort (a degenerate small-panel case where the cohort framework has zero degrees of freedom), the cohort-recentered plug-in formula is unidentified: cohort recentering subtracts the cohort mean from each group's `U^G_g`, and for singleton cohorts the centered value is exactly zero, so the centered influence function vector collapses to all zeros. The estimator returns `overall_se = NaN` with a `UserWarning` rather than silently collapsing to `0.0` (which would falsely imply infinite precision). The `DID_M` point estimate remains well-defined. The bootstrap path inherits the same degeneracy on these panels — the multiplier weights act on an all-zero vector, so the bootstrap distribution is also degenerate. **Deviation from R `DIDmultiplegtDYN`:** R returns a non-zero SE on the canonical 4-group worked example via small-sample sandwich machinery that Python does not implement. Both responses are valid for a degenerate case; Python's `NaN`+warning is the safer default. To get a non-degenerate SE, include more groups so cohorts have peers (real-world panels typically have `G >> K`).

- **Note (cluster contract):** `ChaisemartinDHaultfoeuille` clusters at the group level by default. The analytical SE plug-in operates on per-group influence-function values (one `U^G_g` per group) and, under the cell-period allocator, on their per-cell decomposition `U[g, t]` which telescopes back to `U^G_g` at the PSU-level sum. The multiplier bootstrap generates one weight per group. The user-facing `cluster=` kwarg is not supported: the constructor accepts `cluster=None` (the default and only supported value); passing any non-`None` value raises `NotImplementedError` at construction time (and the same gate fires from `set_params`) — custom user-specified clustering is reserved for a future phase. **Automatic PSU-level clustering under `survey_design`:** the analytical TSL path supports PSU labels that vary across cells of a group (within-cell constancy required); the multiplier bootstrap supports the same regime via the cell-level wild PSU bootstrap documented in the survey + bootstrap contract Note below. Under PSU-within-group-constant regimes (including the default auto-inject `psu=group` and strictly-coarser PSU with within-group constancy), the bootstrap dispatcher routes through the legacy group-level path so the SE is bit-identical to pre-cell-level releases via the identity-map fast path. The matching test for the `cluster=` gate is `test_cluster_parameter_raises_not_implemented` in `tests/test_chaisemartin_dhaultfoeuille.py::TestForwardCompatGates`.

- **Note (bootstrap inference surface):** When `n_bootstrap > 0`, the top-level `results.overall_p_value` / `results.overall_conf_int` (and joiners/leavers analogues) hold **percentile-based bootstrap inference** computed by the multiplier bootstrap, NOT normal-theory recomputations from the bootstrap SE. The t-stat (`overall_t_stat`, etc.) is computed from the SE via `safe_inference()[0]` to satisfy the project's anti-pattern rule (never compute `t = effect / se` inline) — bootstrap does not define an alternative t-stat semantic for percentile bootstrap, so the SE-based t-stat is the natural choice. `event_study_effects[1]`, `summary()`, `to_dataframe()`, `is_significant`, and `significance_stars` all read from these top-level fields and therefore reflect the bootstrap inference automatically. The library precedent for this propagation is `imputation.py:790-805`, `two_stage.py:778-787`, and `efficient_did.py:1009-1013`. The single-period placebo (`L_max=None`) still has NaN bootstrap fields; multi-horizon placebos (`L_max >= 1`) have valid bootstrap SE/CI/p via `placebo_horizon_ses/cis/p_values` on the bootstrap results object. The matching test is `test_bootstrap_p_value_and_ci_propagated_to_top_level` in `tests/test_chaisemartin_dhaultfoeuille.py::TestBootstrap`.

- **Note:** Placebo Assumption 11 violations (placebo joiners exist but no 3-period stable_0 controls, or symmetric for leavers/stable_1) trigger zero-retention in the placebo numerator AND emit a consolidated `Placebo (DID_M^pl) Assumption 11 violations` warning from `fit()`, mirroring the main DID path's contract documented above. The zeroed placebo periods retain their switcher counts in the placebo `N_S^pl` denominator, biasing `DID_M^pl` toward zero in the offending direction (matching the placebo paper convention).

- **Note:** The TWFE diagnostic (`twfe_diagnostic=True` in `fit()` and the standalone `twowayfeweights()`) requires binary `{0, 1}` treatment. On non-binary data, `fit()` emits a `UserWarning` and skips the diagnostic (all `twfe_*` fields are `None`), while `twowayfeweights()` raises `ValueError`. The diagnostic uses `d_gt == 1` as the treated-cell mask per Theorem 1 of AER 2020, which is undefined for non-binary treatment.

- **Note (TWFE diagnostic sample contract):** The fitted `results.twfe_weights` / `results.twfe_fraction_negative` / `results.twfe_sigma_fe` / `results.twfe_beta_fe` are computed on the **FULL pre-filter cell sample** — the data the user passed in, after `_validate_and_aggregate_to_cells()` runs but **before** the ragged-panel validation (Step 5b) and the multi-switch filter (`drop_larger_lower`, Step 6). They do NOT describe the post-filter estimation sample used by `overall_att`, `results.groups`, and the inference fields. `fit()` has three sample-shaping filters in total: (1) interior-gap drops in Step 5b, (2) multi-switch drops in Step 6, and (3) the singleton-baseline filter in Step 7. Filters (1) and (2) actually shrink the point-estimate sample, so when either fires, the fitted TWFE diagnostic and `overall_att` describe **different samples** and the estimator emits a `UserWarning` explaining the divergence with explicit counts. Filter (3) is **variance-only** — singleton-baseline groups remain in the point-estimate sample as period-based stable controls (see the singleton-baseline Note above) — so it does NOT create a fitted-vs-`overall_att` mismatch and does NOT trigger the divergence warning. Rationale for the pre-filter design: the TWFE diagnostic answers "what would the plain TWFE estimator say on the data you passed in?" — not "what would TWFE say on the data dCDH actually used after filtering?" — so users comparing TWFE vs dCDH on a fixed input can do so without an interaction effect from the dCDH-specific filters. The standalone `twowayfeweights()` function uses the same pre-filter sample and accepts the same `survey_design` parameter as `fit()`, so the fitted and standalone APIs always produce identical numbers on the same input — including survey-weighted cell aggregation (`twowayfeweights(data, ..., survey_design=sd)` matches `fit(data, ..., survey_design=sd).twfe_*`). To reproduce the dCDH estimation sample for an external TWFE comparison, pre-process your data to drop the multi-switch and interior-gap groups before fitting (the warning lists offending IDs). The matching tests are `test_twfe_pre_filter_contract_with_interior_gap_drop` and `test_twfe_pre_filter_contract_with_multi_switch_drop` in `tests/test_chaisemartin_dhaultfoeuille.py`.

- **Note:** By default (`drop_larger_lower=True`), the estimator drops groups whose treatment switches more than once before estimation. This matches R `DIDmultiplegtDYN`'s default and is required for the analytical variance formula (Web Appendix Section 3.7.3 of the dynamic paper, which assumes Assumption 5 / no-crossing) to be consistent with the AER 2020 Theorem 3 point estimate. Both formulas operate on the same post-drop dataset. Setting `drop_larger_lower=False` is supported for diagnostic comparison but produces an inconsistent estimator-variance pairing for any multi-switch groups present, and emits an explicit warning.

- **Note:** When Assumption 11 (existence of stable controls) is violated for some period `t` — i.e., joiners exist but no stable-untreated controls, or leavers exist but no stable-treated controls — `DID_{+,t}` (or `DID_{-,t}`) is set to zero by paper convention, and the period's switcher count is **retained** in the `N_S` denominator. This means the affected period contributes a zero to the numerator with a non-zero weight in the denominator, biasing `DID_M` toward zero in the offending direction. Users can detect this by inspecting `results.per_period_effects[t]['did_plus_t_a11_zeroed']` (or `did_minus_t_a11_zeroed`) or the consolidated `fit()` warning. This matches the AER 2020 Theorem 3 paper convention and the worked example arithmetic.

- **Note:** Groups whose baseline treatment value `D_{g,1}` is unique in the post-drop panel (not shared by any other group) are excluded from the **variance computation only** per footnote 15 of the dynamic companion paper. They have no cohort peer for the cohort-recentered plug-in formula. They are **retained in the point-estimate sample** as period-based stable controls (Python's documented period-vs-cohort interpretation). The dropped count is stored on `results.n_groups_dropped_singleton_baseline`, a warning lists example group IDs, and the warning text explicitly states "VARIANCE computation only" so users know the filter does not change `DID_M`.

- **Note (deviation from R DIDmultiplegtDYN):** Python uses **period-based** stable-control sets — `stable_0(t)` is any cell with `D_{g,t-1} = D_{g,t} = 0` regardless of baseline `D_{g,1}`, and similarly for `stable_1(t)`. R `DIDmultiplegtDYN` uses **cohort-based** stable-control sets that additionally require `D_{g,1}` to match the side. Python's definition matches the AER 2020 Theorem 3 cell-count notation `N_{0,0,t}` and `N_{1,1,t}` literally; R's definition matches the dynamic companion paper's cohort `(D_{g,1}, F_g, S_g)` framework. The two definitions agree exactly on (a) panels containing only joiners, (b) panels containing only leavers, (c) the hand-calculable 4-group worked example, or (d) any panel where no joiner's post-switch state overlaps a period when leavers are switching. They disagree by O(1%) on the **point estimate** when both joiners and leavers exist AND some joiners' post-switch cells could serve as leavers' controls (or vice versa). After the Round 2 fix that implemented the full `Lambda^G_{g,l=1}` influence function, the **standard error** parity gap on pure-direction scenarios narrowed from ~18% to ~3%. The R parity tests in `tests/test_chaisemartin_dhaultfoeuille_parity.py` use a tight `1e-4` tolerance for pure-direction point estimates, 10% rtol for multi-horizon SEs (15% for L_max=5 long panels where the cell-count weighting deviation compounds), 5% rtol for single-horizon SEs, and a 2.5% tolerance for mixed-direction point estimates (with the SE check skipped on mixed scenarios because the period-vs-cohort point-estimate deviation cascades into the variance).

- **Note (deviation from R DIDmultiplegtDYN):** Phase 1 requires panels with a **balanced baseline** (every group observed at the first global period) and **no interior period gaps**. The Step 5b validation in `fit()` enforces this contract: groups missing the baseline raise `ValueError`; groups with interior gaps are dropped with a `UserWarning`; groups with **terminal missingness** (early exit / right-censoring — observed at the baseline but missing one or more later periods) are retained and contribute from their observed periods only. R `DIDmultiplegtDYN` accepts unbalanced panels with documented missing-treatment-before-first-switch handling. Python's restriction is a Phase 1 limitation: the cohort enumeration uses `D_{g,1}` as the canonical baseline (so the baseline observation must exist) and the first-switch detection walks adjacent observed periods (so interior gaps create ambiguous transition counts). Terminal missingness is supported at the POINT-ESTIMATE level because the per-period `present = (N_mat[:, t] > 0) & (N_mat[:, t-1] > 0)` guard appears at three sites in the variance computation (`_compute_per_period_dids`, `_compute_full_per_group_contributions`, `_compute_cohort_recentered_inputs`) and cleanly masks out missing transitions without propagating NaN into the arithmetic. **Scope limitation (terminal missingness under any cell-period-allocator path):** under any survey variance path that uses the cell-period allocator, a targeted `ValueError` is raised when cohort-recentering leaks non-zero centered IF mass onto cells with no positive-weight observations. Affected paths:
- **Binder TSL with within-group-varying PSU** (`n_bootstrap=0`, explicit `psu=<col>` that varies within group).
- **Rao-Wu replicate-weight ATT** (`compute_replicate_if_variance` always reads the cell-allocator `psi_obs` per the Class A contract shipped in PR #323, regardless of PSU structure).
- **Cell-level wild PSU bootstrap** (`n_bootstrap > 0` with within-group-varying PSU).

The guard is fired by `_survey_se_from_group_if` (analytical and replicate) and by `_unroll_target_to_cells` (bootstrap). **Unaffected paths**: Binder TSL under PSU-within-group-constant regimes (including PSU=group auto-inject) falls back to the legacy group-level allocator where the row-sum identity `sum_{c in g} U_centered_per_period[g, t] == U_centered[g]` makes the two statistically equivalent, and the bootstrap dispatcher routes the same regimes through the legacy group-level path. **Workaround:** pre-process the panel to remove terminal missingness (drop late-exit groups or trim to a balanced sub-panel). For Binder TSL, using an explicit `psu=<group_col>` routes through the legacy group allocator. For replicate ATT and within-group-varying-PSU bootstrap, there is no allocator fallback — the panel itself must be pre-processed. The broader unbalanced-panel workaround (back-fill the baseline or drop late-entry groups before fitting, or use R `DIDmultiplegtDYN`) also applies. The Step 5b `ValueError` and `UserWarning` messages name the offending group IDs so you can locate them quickly.

- **Note (Phase 3 DID^X covariate adjustment):** When `controls` is set, `per_period_effects` (the Phase 1 per-period DID_M decomposition) remains **unadjusted** (computed on raw outcomes). The covariate residualization applies only to the per-group `DID_{g,l}` path (`L_max >= 1`), which produces `event_study_effects` and `overall_att`. This means `per_period_effects` and `event_study_effects[1]` may diverge when controls are active - by design (the per-period path uses binary joiner/leaver categorization and is not part of the DID^X contract). Implements the residualization-style covariate adjustment from Web Appendix Section 1.2 (Assumption 11). For each baseline treatment value `d`, estimates `theta_hat_d` via OLS of first-differenced outcomes on first-differenced covariates with time FEs, restricted to not-yet-treated observations. Residualizes at levels: `Y_tilde[g,t] = Y[g,t] - X[g,t] @ theta_hat_d`. All downstream DID computations use residualized outcomes. This is NOT doubly-robust, NOT IPW, NOT Callaway-Sant'Anna-style. Plug-in IF (treating `theta_hat` as fixed) is valid by FWL theorem. **Deviation from R `DIDmultiplegtDYN`:** The first-stage OLS uses equal cell weights (one observation per `(g,t)` cell), consistent with the library's cell-count weighting convention documented in Phase 1. R weights by `N_gt` (observation count per cell). On panels with 1 observation per cell (the common case), results are identical. When baseline-specific first stages fail (`n_obs = 0` or `n_obs < n_params`), the affected strata are excluded from the estimation (outcomes set to NaN) rather than retained unadjusted - matching R's "drop failed strata" behavior. Requires `L_max >= 1`. Activated via `controls=["col1", "col2"]` in `fit()`.

- **Note (Phase 3 DID^{fd} linear trends):** Implements group-specific linear trends from Web Appendix Section 1.3 (Assumption 12, Lemma 6). Uses the Z_mat transformation: `Z[g,t] = Y[g,t] - Y[g,t-1]` (first-differenced outcomes). Since `DID_{g,l}(Z) = DID^{fd}_{g,l}` algebraically, the existing multi-horizon DID code produces trend-adjusted estimates when fed Z_mat. Requires F_g >= 3 (at least 2 pre-switch periods); groups with F_g < 3 are excluded with a `UserWarning`. Cumulated level effects `delta^{fd}_l = sum_{l'=1}^l DID^{fd}_{l'}` stored in `results.linear_trends_effects`. Cumulated SE uses conservative upper bound (sum of per-horizon SEs); cross-horizon covariance from IF vectors is a library extension (paper proves Theorem 1 per-horizon, not cross-horizon). When combined with DID^X, residualization is applied first, then first-differencing (per paper assumption ordering). **Suppressed surfaces under `trends_linear`:** `normalized_effects` (`DID^n_l`) and `cost_benefit_delta` are suppressed because they would operate on second-differences rather than level effects. Users should access cumulated level effects via `linear_trends_effects`. Activated via `trends_linear=True` in `fit()`.

- **Note (Phase 3 state-set trends):** Implements state-set-specific trends from Web Appendix Section 1.4 (Assumptions 13-14). Restricts the control pool for each switcher to groups in the same set (e.g., same state in county-level data). The restriction applies in all four DID/IF paths: `_compute_multi_horizon_dids()`, `_compute_per_group_if_multi_horizon()`, `_compute_multi_horizon_placebos()`, and `_compute_per_group_if_placebo_horizon()`. Cohort structure stays as `(D_{g,1}, F_g, S_g)` triples (does not incorporate set membership). Set membership must be time-invariant per group. **Note on Assumption 14 (common support):** The paper requires a common last-untreated period across sets (`T_u^s` equal for all `s`). This implementation does NOT enforce Assumption 14 up front. Instead, when within-set controls are exhausted at a given horizon (because a set has shorter untreated support than others), the affected switcher/horizon pairs are silently excluded via the existing empty-control-pool mechanism. This means `N_l` may be smaller under `trends_nonparam` than without it, and the effective estimand is trimmed to the within-set support at each horizon. The existing multi-horizon A11 warning fires when exclusions occur. Activated via `trends_nonparam="state_column"` in `fit()`.

- **Note (Phase 3 heterogeneity testing - partial implementation):** Partial implementation of the heterogeneity test from Web Appendix Section 1.5 (Assumption 15, Lemma 7). Computes post-treatment saturated OLS regressions of `S_g * (Y_{g, F_g-1+l} - Y_{g, F_g-1})` on a time-invariant covariate `X_g` plus cohort indicator dummies. Standard OLS inference is valid (paper shows no DID error correction needed). **Deviation from R `predict_het`:** R's full `predict_het` option additionally computes placebo regressions and a joint null test, and disallows combination with `controls`. This implementation provides only post-treatment regressions. **Rejected combinations:** `controls` (matching R), `trends_linear` (heterogeneity test uses raw level changes, incompatible with second-differenced outcomes), and `trends_nonparam` (heterogeneity test does not thread state-set control-pool restrictions). Results stored in `results.heterogeneity_effects`. Activated via `heterogeneity="covariate_column"` in `fit()`. **Note (survey support):** Under `survey_design`, heterogeneity uses WLS with per-group weights `W_g = sum of obs-level survey weights in group g`, and the group-level WLS coefficient influence function is `ψ_g[X] = inv(X'WX)[1,:] @ x_g * W_g * r_g`. The group-level IF is then attributed to observation level via **one of two allocators, chosen by variance helper** so each path preserves byte-identity for its aggregation rule: (1) **Binder TSL** (`compute_survey_if_variance`) uses the **cell-period single-cell allocator** — at each horizon `l_h`, `ψ_g` is assigned in full to the post-period cell `(g, out_idx)` with `out_idx = first_switch_idx[g] - 1 + l_h` and expanded as `ψ_i = ψ_g * (w_i / W_{g, out_idx})` for obs in that cell, zero elsewhere (matches the DID_l post-period convention in the Survey IF expansion Note below). Under PSU=group per-observation distribution differs from the legacy `ψ_i = ψ_g * (w_i / W_g)`, but PSU-level aggregates telescope to the same `ψ_g` — so Binder TSL variance is byte-identical to the pre-cell-period release under PSU=group. Under within-group-varying PSU mass lands in the post-period PSU of the transition, which is what Binder TSL needs. An **empty post-period cell under zero-weight obs** (all obs at `(g, out_idx)` have `w_i = 0` despite `N > 0`) drops the group's contribution, matching the ATT cell allocator's convention; the pre-cell-period path diverged here by redistributing mass to other cells of the group. (2) **Rao-Wu replicate** (`compute_replicate_if_variance`) uses the **legacy group-level allocator** `ψ_i = ψ_g * (w_i / W_g)`. Replicate variance computes `θ_r = sum_i ratio_ir * ψ_i` at the observation level, so moving `ψ_g` mass onto the post-period cell only would silently change the replicate SE whenever a replicate column's ratios vary within group (the library accepts arbitrary per-row replicate matrices, not just PSU-aligned ones). Keeping the legacy allocator on this branch preserves byte-identity of replicate SE across every previously-supported fit; replicate + within-group-varying PSU is unreachable by construction (`SurveyDesign` rejects `replicate_weights` combined with explicit `strata/psu/fpc`). Inference uses the t-distribution with `df_survey` when provided. Under rank deficiency (any regression coefficient dropped by `solve_ols`'s R-style drop), all inference fields return NaN (conservative, matches the NaN-consistent contract). **Library extension (replicate weights):** Under a replicate-weight design (BRR/Fay/JK1/JKn/SDR), the heterogeneity regression dispatches to `compute_replicate_if_variance` (Rao-Wu weight-ratio rescaling) instead of the Binder TSL formula. The effective df is the shared `min(resolved_survey.df_survey, min(n_valid_across_sites) - 1)` used by the rest of the dCDH surfaces; if the base `df_survey` is undefined (QR-rank ≤ 1), heterogeneity inference is NaN regardless of the local `n_valid_het` (matching the dCDH top-level contract — per-site `n_valid` cannot rescue a rank-deficient design). **Library extension:** R `DIDmultiplegtDYN::predict_het` does not natively support survey weights. **Scope note (bootstrap):** Heterogeneity inference is analytical (no bootstrap path). When `n_bootstrap > 0` is combined with `heterogeneity=`, the main ATT surfaces receive bootstrap SE/CI (via the cell-level wild PSU bootstrap described in the survey + bootstrap contract Note below) while `heterogeneity_effects` continues to use the Binder TSL / Rao-Wu analytical SE described above. No gate; the two inference paths are independent.

- **Note (HonestDiD integration):** HonestDiD sensitivity analysis (Rambachan & Roth 2023) is available on the placebo + event study surface via `honest_did=True` in `fit()` or `compute_honest_did(results)` post-hoc. **Library extension:** dCDH HonestDiD uses `DID^{pl}_l` placebo estimates as pre-period coefficients rather than standard event-study pre-treatment coefficients. The Rambachan-Roth restrictions bound violations of the parallel trends assumption underlying the dCDH placebo estimand; interpretation differs from canonical event-study HonestDiD. A `UserWarning` is emitted at runtime. Uses diagonal variance (no full VCV available for dCDH). Relative magnitudes (DeltaRM) with Mbar=1.0 is the default when called from `fit()`, targeting the equal-weight average over all post-treatment horizons (`l_vec=None`). R's HonestDiD defaults to the first post/on-impact effect; use `compute_honest_did(results, ...)` with a custom `l_vec` to match that behavior. When `trends_linear=True`, bounds apply to the second-differenced estimand (parallel trends in first differences). Requires `L_max >= 1` for multi-horizon placebos. Gaps in the horizon grid from `trends_nonparam` support-trimming are handled by filtering to the largest consecutive block and warning.

- **Note (Phase 3 Design-2 switch-in/switch-out):** Convenience wrapper for Web Appendix Section 1.6 (Assumption 16). Identifies groups with exactly 2 treatment changes (join then leave), reports switch-in and switch-out mean effects. This is a descriptive summary, not a full re-estimation with specialized control pools as described in the paper. **Always uses raw (unadjusted) outcomes** regardless of active `controls`, `trends_linear`, or `trends_nonparam` options - those adjustments apply to the main estimator surface but not to the Design-2 descriptive block. For full adjusted Design-2 estimation with proper control pools, the paper recommends "running the command on a restricted subsample and using `trends_nonparam` for the entry-timing grouping." Activated via `design2=True` in `fit()`, requires `drop_larger_lower=False` to retain 2-switch groups.

- **Note (Phase 3 `by_path` per-path event-study disaggregation):** Per-path disaggregation of the multi-horizon event study, mirroring R `did_multiplegt_dyn(..., by_path=k)`. Activated via `ChaisemartinDHaultfoeuille(by_path=k, drop_larger_lower=False)` where `k` is a positive integer (top-k most common observed paths by switcher-group frequency). **Window convention:** the path tuple for a switcher group `g` is `(D_{g, F_g-1}, D_{g, F_g}, ..., D_{g, F_g-1+L_max})` — length `L_max + 1`, matching R's window `[F_{g-1}, F_{g-1+l}]`. **Ranking:** paths are ranked by descending frequency; ties are broken lexicographically on the path tuple for deterministic ordering, so every selected path has a unique `frequency_rank`. If `by_path` exceeds the number of observed paths, all observed paths are returned with a `UserWarning`. **Per-path SE convention (joiners/leavers precedent):** the per-path influence function follows the joiners-only / leavers-only IF construction at `chaisemartin_dhaultfoeuille.py:5495-5504`: the switcher-side contribution `+S_g * (Y_{g,out} - Y_{g,ref})` is zeroed for groups whose observed trajectory is NOT the selected path; control contributions and the full cohort structure `(D_{g,1}, F_g, S_g)` are unchanged. After applying the singleton-baseline eligible mask and cohort-recentering with the original cohort IDs, the plug-in SE uses the path-specific divisor `N_l_path` (count of path switchers eligible at horizon `l`) — same pattern as `joiners_se` using `joiner_total`. This gives the **within-path mean** estimand `DID_{path,l}` as the within-path average of `DID_{g,l}`. **Degenerate-cohort behavior per path:** when a path's centered IF at some horizon is identically zero (every variance-eligible path switcher forms its own `(D_{g,1}, F_g, S_g)` cohort, or the path has a single contributing group), SE / t_stat / p_value / conf_int are NaN-consistent and a `UserWarning` is emitted scoped to `(path, horizon)`. This mirrors the overall-path degenerate-cohort surface and is common for rare paths with few contributing groups. **Empty-state contract:** `results.path_effects` distinguishes "not requested" (`None`) from "requested but empty" (`{}` — all switchers have windows outside the panel or unobserved cells). The empty-dict case emits a `UserWarning` at fit-time and renders as an explicit "no observed paths" notice in `summary()`; `to_dataframe(level="by_path")` returns an empty DataFrame with the canonical column set (mirrors the `linear_trends` pattern when `trends_linear=True` but no horizons survive). **Requirements:** `drop_larger_lower=False` (multi-switch groups are the object of interest; default `True` filters them out) and `L_max >= 1` (path window depends on the horizon). **Scope:** combinations with `heterogeneity`, `design2`, and `honest_did` remain gated behind explicit `NotImplementedError` (deferred to follow-up wave PRs). `n_bootstrap > 0` is now supported — see the **Bootstrap SE** paragraph below. `survey_design` is supported under analytical Binder TSL and replicate-weight bootstrap — see the **Per-path survey-design SE** paragraph below; multiplier bootstrap (`n_bootstrap > 0`) under `survey_design + by_path/paths_of_interest` remains gated. `placebo=True` is now supported per-path — see the **Per-path placebos** paragraph below. **TWFE diagnostic** remains a sample-level summary (not computed per path) in this release. Results are exposed on `results.path_effects` as `Dict[Tuple[int, ...], Dict[str, Any]]` with nested `horizons` dicts per horizon `l`, and on `results.to_dataframe(level="by_path")` as a long-format table with columns `[path, frequency_rank, n_groups, horizon, effect, se, t_stat, p_value, conf_int_lower, conf_int_upper, n_obs, cband_lower, cband_upper, cumulated_effect, cumulated_se]` (the `cband_*` columns are added by the joint sup-t Note below, populated for positive-horizon rows of paths with a finite sup-t crit and NaN otherwise; the `cumulated_*` columns are added by the per-path linear-trends Note below, populated for positive-horizon rows when `trends_linear=True` is set and NaN otherwise). Gated tests live in `tests/test_chaisemartin_dhaultfoeuille.py::TestByPathGates` / `::TestByPathBehavior` / `::TestByPathEdgeCases`. **R-parity** against `DIDmultiplegtDYN 2.3.3` is confirmed at `tests/test_chaisemartin_dhaultfoeuille_parity.py::TestDCDHDynRParityByPath` via two scenarios: `mixed_single_switch_by_path` (2 paths, `by_path=2`) and `multi_path_reversible_by_path` (4 paths, `by_path=3`; path-assignment deterministic on `F_g` so each `(D_{g,1}, F_g, S_g)` cohort contains switchers from a single path). Per-path point estimates and per-path switcher counts match R exactly; per-path SE matches within the Phase 2 multi-horizon SE envelope (observed rtol ≤ 10.2% on the 2-path mixed scenario, ≤ 4.2% on the 4-path cohort-clean scenario). **Deviation from R (cross-path cohort-sharing SE):** our analytical SE is the marginal variance of the path-contribution estimator cohort-centered on the *full-panel* cohort structure (joiners/leavers precedent — non-path switchers contribute to cohort means via their zeroed switcher row). R's `did_multiplegt_dyn(..., by_path=k)` re-runs the estimator per path, so cohort means are computed over the path's own switchers only. When a cohort `(D_{g,1}, F_g, S_g)` spans multiple observed paths, Python and R SE diverge materially (our empirical probes with random post-window toggling saw rtol > 100%); when every cohort is single-path (scenario 13 by design, scenario 14 by construction), the two approaches coincide up to the documented Phase 2 envelope. Practitioners with cohort structures that mix paths should interpret the per-path SE as a within-full-panel marginal variance, not a per-path conditional variance. **Bootstrap SE:** when `n_bootstrap > 0` is set, the top-k paths are enumerated once on the observed data (R-faithful: matches `did_multiplegt_dyn(..., by_path=k, bootstrap=B)`'s path-stability convention — verified empirically against DIDmultiplegtDYN 2.3.3) and the multiplier bootstrap (`bootstrap_weights ∈ {"rademacher", "mammen", "webb"}`) runs per `(path, horizon)` target via the shared `_bootstrap_one_target` / `compute_effect_bootstrap_stats` helpers. Point estimates are unchanged from the analytical path. Bootstrap SE replaces the analytical SE in `path_effects[path]["horizons"][l]["se"]`, and `p_value` / `conf_int` are taken as the **bootstrap percentile** statistics, matching the Round-10 library convention for overall / joiners / leavers / multi-horizon bootstrap (see the `Note (bootstrap inference surface)` elsewhere in this file and the pinned regression `test_bootstrap_p_value_and_ci_propagated_to_top_level`). `t_stat` is SE-derived via `safe_inference` per the anti-pattern rule. Interpretation: inference is *conditional on the observed path set*. **SE inherits the analytical cross-path cohort-sharing deviation:** the bootstrap input is the exact same full-panel cohort-centered path IF that the analytical path computes (`_collect_path_bootstrap_inputs` reuses the same enumeration / cohort IDs / IF construction), so the bootstrap SE is a Monte Carlo analog of the analytical SE — it inherits the same cross-path cohort-sharing deviation from R's per-path re-run convention documented above. On single-path-cohort panels (scenarios 13 and 14 of the R-parity fixture, and any DGP where `(D_{g,1}, F_g, S_g)` cohorts never span multiple observed paths), bootstrap SE tracks analytical SE up to Monte Carlo noise and both coincide with R up to the Phase 2 envelope. On cross-path cohort panels, bootstrap SE inherits the >100% rtol divergence from R that analytical already has. **Deviation from R (CI method):** R's per-path CI is normal-theory around the bootstrap SE (half-width ≈ `1.96·se`); ours is the bootstrap percentile CI, intentionally diverging from R to keep the dCDH inference surface internally consistent across all bootstrap targets. Practitioners who want *unconditional* inference capturing path-selection uncertainty need a pairs-bootstrap (deferred — no R precedent). Positive regressions live in `tests/test_chaisemartin_dhaultfoeuille.py::TestByPathBootstrap` (gated `@pytest.mark.slow`): point-estimate invariance, finite positive SE on non-degenerate panels, SE-within-30%-rtol of analytical on cohort-clean fixtures, degenerate-cohort NaN propagation, Rademacher/Mammen/Webb parity, seed reproducibility, and percentile-vs-normal-theory CI pinning. **Per-path placebos:** when `placebo=True` (and `L_max >= 1`) is combined with `by_path=k`, per-path backward-horizon placebos `DID^{pl}_{path, l}` for `l = 1..L_max` are computed using the same joiners/leavers IF precedent applied to `_compute_per_group_if_placebo_horizon` (with the new `switcher_subset_mask` parameter): switcher contributions are zeroed for groups not in the path; the control pool and the variance-eligible cohort structure `(D_{g,1}, F_g, S_g)` are unchanged. Plug-in SE uses the path-specific divisor `N^{pl}_{l, path}` (count of path switchers eligible at backward lag `l`). Surfaced on `results.path_placebo_event_study[path][-l]` with the same `{effect, se, t_stat, p_value, conf_int, n_obs}` shape as `placebo_event_study` (negative-int inner keys parallel the existing per-path event-study positive-int keys, so a unified forward+backward view is well-formed). **Inherits the cross-path cohort-sharing SE deviation from R** documented above for `path_effects` (same convention applied backward); tracks R within numerical tolerance on single-path-cohort panels and diverges on cohort-mixed panels. Multiplier bootstrap (when `n_bootstrap > 0`) runs per `(path, lag)` target via the same `_bootstrap_one_target` dispatch used for the per-path event-study, with the canonical NaN-on-invalid contract. The bootstrap SE is a Monte Carlo analog of the analytical placebo SE — same per-path centered IF input — and inherits the same deviation. Surfaced through `summary()` (negative-keyed rows rendered alongside positive-keyed event-study rows under each path block) and `to_dataframe(level="by_path")` (`horizon` column takes negative ints for placebo rows). **Empty-state contract:** `results.path_placebo_event_study` mirrors `path_effects` — `None` when `by_path + placebo` was not requested, `{}` when requested but no observed path has a complete window within the panel (same regime that returns `{}` for `path_effects`, with the same fit-time `UserWarning`). R-parity is confirmed at `tests/test_chaisemartin_dhaultfoeuille_parity.py::TestDCDHDynRParityByPathPlacebo` on the `multi_path_reversible_by_path_placebo` scenario; positive analytical + bootstrap invariants live in `tests/test_chaisemartin_dhaultfoeuille.py::TestByPathPlacebo` (with the gated `::TestByPathPlacebo::TestBootstrap` subclass). **Per-path covariate residualization (DID^X):** when `controls=[...]` is set with `by_path=k`, the per-baseline OLS residualization (Web Appendix Section 1.2) runs once on the first-differenced outcome BEFORE path enumeration. All four downstream surfaces — analytical per-path SE, bootstrap SE, per-path placebos, and per-path joint sup-t bands — consume the residualized `Y_mat` automatically (Frisch-Waugh-Lovell). Per-period effects remain unadjusted, consistent with the existing `controls` + per-period DID contract (per-period DID does not support residualization). Failed-stratum baselines (rank-deficient X) zero out `N_mat` for affected groups, which the path enumeration treats as ineligible per its existing convention. **Deviation from R on multi-baseline switcher panels (point estimates):** R `did_multiplegt_dyn(..., by_path, controls)` re-runs the per-baseline residualization on each path's restricted subsample (`R/R/did_multiplegt_dyn.R` lines 401-405: rows of the path's switchers OR rows where `yet_to_switch=1 AND baseline matches the path's baseline`). The first-stage residualization sample R uses for path B equals: pre-switch rows of all switchers with matching baseline + all rows of never-switchers with matching baseline — bit-identical to our global first-stage sample under single-baseline switcher panels (every switcher shares the same `D_{g,1}`, regardless of how `F_g` or path identity varies across switchers). Per-path point estimates therefore coincide with R on those panels up to the existing **DID^X first-stage cell-weighting deviation** documented above in `Note (Phase 3 DID^X covariate adjustment)` (Python's first-stage OLS uses equal cell weights — one observation per `(g, t)` cell, consistent with the library's cell-aggregated input convention; R weights by `N_gt`). On panels with one observation per `(g, t)` cell (the common case after the cell-aggregation step in `fit()`), Python matches R bit-exactly: the `multi_path_reversible_by_path_controls` parity fixture has 4 paths with switcher `F_g` values spanning [0..6] under `D_{g,1}=0` and Python matches R to rtol ~1e-11. On multi-baseline switcher panels (some switchers have `D_{g,1}=0`, others have `D_{g,1}=1`) R's per-path subset drops switchers whose baseline differs from the path's baseline, so the per-baseline regression coefficients diverge per path under R and point estimates can diverge between Python and R — a `UserWarning` is emitted at fit-time when this configuration is detected so practitioners do not silently consume estimates that disagree with R. The warning filters to switcher groups only; never-switchers (never-treated + always-treated controls) at multiple baseline values do NOT trigger the warning because they don't affect R's per-path subset construction. **Inherits the cross-path cohort-sharing SE deviation from R** documented above for `path_effects` — bootstrap SE, placebo SE, and sup-t crit are Monte Carlo / joint-distribution analogs of the same residualized analytical IF and carry the same deviation. R-parity is confirmed against `did_multiplegt_dyn(..., by_path=3, controls="X1")` at `tests/test_chaisemartin_dhaultfoeuille_parity.py::TestDCDHDynRParityByPathControls` on the `multi_path_reversible_by_path_controls` scenario (single-baseline DGP, exact point-estimate match measured rtol ~1e-11); cross-surface inheritance and the multi-baseline warning are regression-tested at `tests/test_chaisemartin_dhaultfoeuille.py::TestByPathControls` (analytical + bootstrap + placebo + sup-t + `to_dataframe(level="by_path")` cband columns + multi-baseline `UserWarning`). **Per-path linear-trends DID^{fd}:** when `trends_linear=True` is set with `by_path=k`, the first-differencing transform at `chaisemartin_dhaultfoeuille.py:1599-1630` runs once globally BEFORE path enumeration (replaces `Y_mat` with `Z_mat = Y_t - Y_{t-1}` and shrinks the time axis by one), so per-path raw second-differences `DID^{fd}_{path, l}` surface on `path_effects[path]["horizons"][l]` automatically. Per-path cumulated level effects `delta_{path, l} = sum_{l'=1..l} DID^{fd}_{path, l'}` (the quantity R returns under `did_multiplegt_dyn(..., by_path, trends_lin)` per the existing parity test pivot at `tests/test_chaisemartin_dhaultfoeuille_parity.py:403-409`) surface on the new `results.path_cumulated_event_study[path][l]` field — a per-group running sum of `DID^{fd}_{g, l'}` averaged over the path's switchers eligible at horizon `l`, mirroring the global `linear_trends_effects` cumulation logic at `chaisemartin_dhaultfoeuille.py:3340-3398`. SE on the cumulated layer is the conservative upper bound (sum of per-horizon component SEs from `path_effects[path]["horizons"][l]["se"]`, NaN-consistent: any non-finite component yields a NaN cumulated SE). **Post-bootstrap recomputation:** the cumulated layer is built AFTER the bootstrap propagation block at `chaisemartin_dhaultfoeuille.py:3034-3081` so it reads the FINAL post-bootstrap per-horizon SEs (mirrors the global `linear_trends_effects` placement). When `n_bootstrap > 0`, cumulated SE / t / p / CI are derived from bootstrap per-horizon SEs; when bootstrap produces non-finite SE (e.g., `n_bootstrap=1` degenerate distribution), the cumulated layer's full inference tuple is NaN per the library-wide NaN-on-invalid bootstrap contract. `to_dataframe(level="by_path")` exposes `cumulated_effect` and `cumulated_se` columns (always present, NaN-when-None — mirrors the `cband_*` always-present convention from PR #374). `summary()` renders a `Cumulated Level Effects (DID^{fd}, trends_linear)` sub-section under each per-path block. **Path enumeration uses the post-first-differenced `N_mat_fd`**: switchers with `F_g==2` fail the window-eligibility check and are dropped from path enumeration entirely (the existing global `F_g >= 3` warning at line 1620 surfaces the issue), so a path whose switchers all have `F_g < 3` is silently absent from `path_effects` rather than present-with-NaN. **F_g=3 boundary-case divergence (`by_path + trends_linear`):** `F_g=3` switchers have exactly 2 pre-switch periods, which after first-differencing and the `time==1` filter leaves only 1 valid pre-window Z value. R's per-path full-pipeline call handles this single-pre-period regime differently from Python's global-then-disaggregate architecture, producing 30%+ relative divergence on point estimates for paths whose switchers include `F_g=3` (empirically observed on the parity fixture's earlier `F_g=3` variant). A separate `UserWarning` fires at fit-time when the panel includes any `F_g=3` switcher AND `by_path + trends_linear` is set, mirroring the `F_g < 3` exclusion warning. The shipped parity fixture (`single_baseline_multi_path_by_path_trends_lin`) restricts to `F_g >= 4` exclusively to avoid this regime; per-path R parity is asserted only there. **Placebo under `trends_linear` returns RAW per-horizon values** (no per-path placebo cumulation surface) — verified empirically against the existing `joiners_only_trends_lin` parity fixture: R's per-path Placebo_l matches Python's `path_placebo_event_study[path][-l]` (raw) bit-exactly under non-`by_path` trends_lin. **Deviation from R on multi-baseline switcher panels (point estimates):** R `did_multiplegt_dyn(..., by_path, trends_lin)` re-runs the full pipeline (including first-differencing) on each path's restricted subsample, so it operates on different switcher samples per path when switchers have different baseline values `D_{g,1}`. Python first-differences once globally before path enumeration. On single-baseline switcher panels the two architectures coincide; on multi-baseline switcher panels per-path point estimates can diverge — a `UserWarning` is emitted at fit-time when this configuration is detected so practitioners do not silently consume estimates that disagree with R (mirroring the analogous `by_path + controls` warning). Per-path R parity is confirmed against `did_multiplegt_dyn(..., by_path=3, trends_lin=TRUE, placebo=1)` at `tests/test_chaisemartin_dhaultfoeuille_parity.py::TestDCDHDynRParityByPathTrendsLinear` on the `single_baseline_multi_path_by_path_trends_lin` scenario (single-baseline + cohort-single-path + `F_g >= 4` DGP designed to eliminate the multi-baseline divergence, the cross-path cohort-sharing deviation, and the F_g=3 boundary case under R's per-path full-pipeline call). Per-path cumulated point estimates match R bit-exactly (rtol ~1e-9) on event horizons under those conditions; cumulated SE_RTOL is widened to `0.20` (vs `0.12` used for non-cumulated by_path parity) because the conservative upper-bound SE compounds the cross-path cohort-sharing deviation under summation. **Placebo parity is intentionally skipped for `trends_linear`**: R's per-path placebo computation re-runs on the path-restricted subsample with different control eligibility than Python's global-then-disaggregate architecture surfaces, producing a sign-and-magnitude divergence on paths whose switchers have minimal pre-window depth (e.g., `F_g=4` switchers). Placebo under `by_path + trends_linear` is exercised via internal regression in `tests/test_chaisemartin_dhaultfoeuille.py::TestByPathTrendsLinear` (finite values, bootstrap inheritance) but not pinned to R bit-by-bit. Cross-surface invariants (analytical + bootstrap + placebo + sup-t + `path_cumulated_event_study` + `to_dataframe` columns + `summary()` rendering) are regression-tested at `TestByPathTrendsLinear`. **Per-path state-set trends:** when `trends_nonparam="state_col"` is set with `by_path=k`, the set membership column is validated and stored once globally as `set_ids_arr` (time-invariance, NaN rejection, partition-coarseness checks unchanged from the non-by_path path). The `set_ids` parameter is threaded through the four per-path IF helpers (`_compute_path_effects`, `_compute_path_placebos`, `_collect_path_bootstrap_inputs`, `_collect_path_placebo_bootstrap_inputs`) so per-path analytical SE, bootstrap, placebos, and sup-t bands all consume the set-restricted control pool automatically. R does NOT first-difference and does NOT cumulate under `trends_nonparam` (unlike `trends_lin`); per-horizon `Effect_l` is a normal DID with set-restricted controls. Per-path R parity is confirmed against `did_multiplegt_dyn(..., by_path=3, trends_nonparam="state", placebo=1)` at `tests/test_chaisemartin_dhaultfoeuille_parity.py::TestDCDHDynRParityByPathTrendsNonparam` on the `multi_path_reversible_by_path_trends_nonparam` scenario; per-path point estimates AND placebos match R bit-exactly (rtol ~1e-9), per-path SE matches within the Phase 2 envelope (~13% rtol observed). Cross-surface invariants are regression-tested at `tests/test_chaisemartin_dhaultfoeuille.py::TestByPathTrendsNonparam`. **Per-path non-binary treatment:** integer-coded discrete treatment (D in Z, e.g. ordinal {0, 1, 2}) is supported under `by_path=k` and `paths_of_interest`. Path tuples become integer-state tuples (`(0, 2, 2, 2)`) keyed bit-for-bit against R's comma-separated path strings (`"0,2,2,2"`) for D in {0..9}. Continuous D (e.g. `1.5`) raises `ValueError` at fit-time per the no-silent-failures contract — the existing `int(round(float(v)))` cast in `_enumerate_treatment_paths` is now defensive (no-op for integer-coded D). **Deviation from R for D >= 10:** R's `did_multiplegt_by_path` derives the per-path baseline via `path_index$baseline_XX <- substr(path_index$path, 1, 1)` (extracted 2026-05-03 via `Rscript -e 'cat(paste(deparse(DIDmultiplegtDYN:::did_multiplegt_by_path), collapse="\n"))'`), capturing only the first character of the comma-separated path string. For D >= 10 this captures `"1"` instead of `"12"` for `path = "12,12,..."`, mis-allocating R's per-path control-pool subset. Python's tuple-key matching is correct in this regime; the per-path point estimates we compute are correct, R's per-path subset for the same path is buggy. The shipped parity scenario stays in `D in {0, 1, 2}` to avoid the R bug; R-parity for D in {0..9} is asserted at `tests/test_chaisemartin_dhaultfoeuille_parity.py::TestDCDHDynRParityByPathNonBinary` on the `multi_path_reversible_by_path_non_binary` scenario (78 switchers, 3 paths, single-baseline custom DGP, F_g >= 4) — per-path point estimates match R bit-exactly (rtol ~1e-9 events; rtol+atol envelope for placebo near-zero values), SE inherits the documented cross-path cohort-sharing deviation (~5% rtol observed; SE_RTOL=0.15 envelope). Cross-surface invariants regression-tested at `tests/test_chaisemartin_dhaultfoeuille.py::TestByPathNonBinary`. **Per-path survey-design SE** (analytical Binder TSL + replicate-weight bootstrap): under `by_path` / `paths_of_interest` + `survey_design`, the per-path per-horizon SE routes through `_survey_se_from_group_if` using the cell-period allocator. The per-path influence function `U_pp_l_path` is the per-period IF with non-path switcher-side contributions skipped — control contributions remain unchanged, matching the joiners/leavers IF convention from the **Per-path SE convention** paragraph above (the `switcher_subset_mask` zeroes the switcher row of the per-group IF, which trivially zeroes the corresponding row of the per-cell IF, preserving the row-sum identity `U_pp.sum(axis=1) == U`). The IF is cohort-recentered via `_cohort_recenter_per_period` and expanded to observations as `psi_i = U_pp[g_i, t_i] · (w_i / W_{g_i, t_i})`. Replicate-weight designs unconditionally route through the cell allocator (Class A contract, PR #323). Multiplier bootstrap (`n_bootstrap > 0`) under `survey_design + by_path/paths_of_interest` raises `NotImplementedError` at fit-time — the survey-aware perturbation pivot for path-restricted IFs is methodologically underived and deferred to a future wave; the global non-by_path TSL multiplier bootstrap is unaffected and continues to ship. **Path-enumeration ranking is unweighted** under `survey_design`: top-k selection uses group cardinality (`path_to_count[p]` = number of groups), not population-weight mass — survey weights do not affect which paths are selected as "top-k". A weighted-ranking variant (sum of survey weights per path) is deferred until concrete demand. **`df_survey` propagation:** under replicate weights, every per-path per-horizon fit contributes an `n_valid` count to the shared `_replicate_n_valid_list` accumulator and the final `_effective_df_survey = min(...) - 1` reflects all per-path replicate fits. A post-call `_refresh_path_inference` helper re-runs `safe_inference` on every populated entry so `multi_horizon_inference`, `placebo_horizon_inference`, `path_effects`, and `path_placebos` all use the same final df after per-path appends complete. **Lonely-PSU policy is sample-wide, not per-path** — the `lonely_psu` policy (`remove`/`certainty`/`adjust`) operates on the full design-level PSU/strata structure, not on path-restricted subsamples. **Telescope invariant:** on a single-path panel where every switcher follows the same trajectory and `eligible_groups` matches between by_path and non-by_path, per-path SE equals the global non-by_path survey SE bit-exactly — pinned at `tests/test_chaisemartin_dhaultfoeuille.py::TestByPathSurveyDesignTelescope::test_telescope_analytical_TSL`. **Deviation from R:** none — R `did_multiplegt_dyn` does not support survey weighting, so this is a Python-only methodology extension (no R parity available; no R parity test class). Regression test anchor: `tests/test_chaisemartin_dhaultfoeuille.py::TestByPathSurveyDesignAnalytical` covering analytical SE, replicate-weight SE, the `n_bootstrap` gate, the global anti-regression, per-path placebos, `trends_linear` composition, and unobserved-path warnings under survey. **Per-path user-specified path selection (`paths_of_interest`):** Python-only API extension — R's `did_multiplegt_dyn(..., by_path=k)` only accepts a positive int (top-k automatic ranking) or `-1` (all observed paths) and provides no list-based selection. Activated via `ChaisemartinDHaultfoeuille(paths_of_interest=[(0, 1, 1, 1), (0, 1, 0, 0)], drop_larger_lower=False)` as an alternative to `by_path=k`; the two are **mutually exclusive** (setting both raises `ValueError` at `__init__` and `set_params` time). Each path tuple must have length `L_max + 1`; the type / element / non-empty / length-uniformity checks fire at `__init__`, the length-vs-L_max check fires at fit-time. `bool` and `np.bool_` are explicitly rejected; `np.integer` is accepted and canonicalized to Python `int` for tuple-key consistency. Duplicates emit a `UserWarning` and are deduplicated; paths not observed in the panel emit a `UserWarning` and are omitted from `path_effects`. Paths appear in `results.path_effects` in the user-specified order, modulo deduplication and unobserved-path filtering. Composes with non-binary D and all downstream `by_path` surfaces (bootstrap, per-path placebos, per-path joint sup-t bands, `controls`, `trends_linear`, `trends_nonparam`) — mechanical filter on observed paths, no methodology change. Behavior + cross-feature regressions live at `tests/test_chaisemartin_dhaultfoeuille.py::TestPathsOfInterest`.

- **Note (Phase 3 `by_path` per-path joint sup-t bands):** When `n_bootstrap > 0` is set with `by_path=k`, per-path joint sup-t simultaneous confidence bands are computed across horizons `1..L_max` within each path. **Methodology:** a single `(n_bootstrap, n_eligible)` multiplier weight matrix (using the estimator's configured `bootstrap_weights` — Rademacher / Mammen / Webb) is drawn per path and broadcast across all horizons of that path, producing correlated bootstrap distributions across horizons within the path. The path-specific critical value `c_p = quantile(max_l |t_l|, 1 - α)` is then used to construct symmetric joint bands `effect_l ± c_p · se_l` per horizon, surfaced in `path_effects[path]["horizons"][l]["cband_conf_int"]` and at top-level `results.path_sup_t_bands[path] = {"crit_value", "alpha", "n_bootstrap", "method", "n_valid_horizons"}`. **Gates:** a path must have `>= 2` valid horizons (finite bootstrap SE > 0) AND a strict majority (more than 50%) of finite sup-t draws to receive a band; otherwise the path is absent from `path_sup_t_bands`. Both gates mirror the OVERALL `event_study_sup_t_bands` semantics at `chaisemartin_dhaultfoeuille_bootstrap.py:605,612`: `len(valid_horizons) >= 2` AND `finite_mask.sum() > 0.5 * n_bootstrap`. Exactly half-finite draws are NOT enough — the gate is strictly greater than half. **Empty-state contract:** `path_sup_t_bands is None` when not requested (no bootstrap, or both `by_path` and `paths_of_interest` are `None`); `{}` when requested but no path passes both gates. **`to_dataframe(level="by_path")` integration:** the table now includes `cband_lower` / `cband_upper` columns for parity with OVERALL `level="event_study"`; populated for positive-horizon rows of paths with a finite sup-t crit, NaN for placebo rows / unbanded paths / the requested-but-empty fallback DataFrame. **Methodology asymmetry vs OVERALL:** OVERALL sup-t reuses the same multi-horizon shared-draw distribution for both the SE in the t-stat denominator and the bootstrap distribution in the numerator. The per-path sup-t draws a fresh shared weight matrix per path AFTER the per-path SE bootstrap block has already populated `results.path_ses` via independent per-(path, horizon) draws — numerator: fresh shared draws, denominator: bootstrap SEs from the earlier independent draws. Asymptotically equivalent to OVERALL's self-consistent reuse, but NOT bit-identical. The fresh draw is intentional: it preserves RNG-state isolation and keeps every existing per-path SE seed-reproducibility test bit-stable post-implementation. **Inherited deviation from R:** the bootstrap SE used as the t-stat denominator carries the cross-path cohort-sharing SE deviation from R documented for `path_effects` above; the per-path sup-t crit therefore inherits the same deviation. **Interpretation:** the band covers joint inference *within a single path across horizons*; it does NOT provide simultaneous coverage *across paths* (a different inference target requiring a `path × horizon` re-derivation, deferred to a future wave). **Deviation from R:** `did_multiplegt_dyn` provides no joint / sup-t / simultaneous bands at any surface — this is a Python-only methodology extension, consistent with the existing OVERALL `event_study_sup_t_bands` (also Python-only). Regression test anchor: `tests/test_chaisemartin_dhaultfoeuille.py::TestByPathSupTBands`.

Opt-in **PSU-level Hall-Mammen wild bootstrap** is also supported via `n_bootstrap > 0`.
- **Note (Survey IF expansion — library convention):** Survey IF expansion is a library extension not in the dCDH papers (the paper's plug-in variance assumes iid sampling). The library convention builds observation-level `psi_i` by proportionally distributing per-group IF mass within weight share: either at the group level (`psi_i = U_centered[g] * w_i / W_g`, the previous convention) or at the per-`(g, t)` cell level via the cell-period allocator shipped in this release. Cell-level expansion: decompose `U[g]` into per-period attributions `U[g, t]`, cohort-center each column independently, then expand to observation level as `psi_i = U_centered_per_period[g_i, t_i] * (w_i / W_{g_i, t_i})`. Binder (1983) stratified-PSU variance aggregates the resulting `psi` at PSU level. **Post-period attribution convention:** each transition term in the IF sum (of the form `role_weight * (Y_{g, t} - Y_{g, t-1})` for DID_M or `S_g * (Y_{g, out} - Y_{g, ref})` for DID_l) is attributed as a single *difference* to the POST-period cell, not split into a `+Y_post` / `-Y_pre` pair across two cells. This is a library *convention*, not a theorem — adopted because it preserves the group-sum, PSU-sum, and cohort-sum identities of the previous group-level expansion (so Binder variance coincides with the group-level variance under the auto-injected `psu=group`) and because Monte Carlo coverage at nominal 95% is empirically close to nominal on a DGP where PSUs vary across the cells of each group (see `tests/test_dcdh_cell_period_coverage.py`). A covariance-aware two-cell allocator is a plausible alternative and may be worth exploring if future designs motivate an explicit observation-level IF derivation; the method currently in the library is **not derived from the observation-level survey linearization of the contrast** and makes no stronger claim than "coverage is approximately nominal under the tested DGPs and the group-sum identity holds exactly." Under within-group-constant PSU (the pre-allocator accepted input), per-cell sums telescope to `U_centered[g]` and Binder variance is byte-identical (up to single-ULP floating-point noise) to the previous group-level expansion. **Strata and PSU must be constant within each `(g, t)` cell** (trivially satisfied in one-obs-per-cell panels — the canonical dCDH structure); variation **across cells of a group** is supported by the allocator. Within-group-varying **weights** are supported as before. When `survey_design.psu` is not specified, `fit()` auto-injects `psu=<group column>` so the TSL variance, `df_survey`, and t-based inference match the per-group PSU structure. **Strata that vary across cells of a group require either an explicit `psu=<col>` or the original `SurveyDesign(..., nest=True)` flag** — under `nest=True` the resolver combines `(stratum, psu)` into globally-unique labels, so the auto-injected `psu=<group>` is re-labeled per stratum and the cell allocator proceeds. Only the `nest=False` + varying-strata + omitted-psu combination is rejected up front with a targeted `ValueError` at `fit()` time (the synthesized PSU column would reuse group labels across strata and trip the cross-stratum PSU uniqueness check in `SurveyDesign.resolve()`). Under replicate-weight designs, the same cell-level `psi_i` is aggregated via Rao-Wu weight-ratio rescaling (`compute_replicate_if_variance` at `diff_diff/survey.py:1681`) rather than the Binder TSL formula. All five methods (BRR/Fay/JK1/JKn/SDR) are supported method-agnostically through the unified helper; the effective `df_survey` is reduced to `min(n_valid) - 1` across IF sites when some replicate solves fail (matching `efficient_did.py:1133-1135` and `triple_diff.py:676-686` precedents). Under DID^X, the first-stage residualization coefficient `theta_hat` is computed once on full-sample weights and treated as fixed (FWL plug-in IF convention) — per-replicate refits of `theta_hat` are not performed. **Post-period attribution extends to heterogeneity (Binder TSL branch only):** the heterogeneity WLS coefficient IF `ψ_g = inv(X'WX)[1,:] @ x_g * W_g * r_g` is attributed in full to the single post-period cell `(g, out_idx)` at each horizon (same single-cell convention as DID_l), then expanded as `ψ_i = ψ_g * (w_i / W_{g, out_idx})`, and fed through `compute_survey_if_variance`. Under PSU=group the PSU-level aggregate telescopes to `ψ_g`, so Binder variance is byte-identical relative to the pre-cell-period release; under within-group-varying PSU mass lands in the post-period PSU. **Replicate-weight branch keeps the legacy group-level allocator** `ψ_i = ψ_g * (w_i / W_g)` because `compute_replicate_if_variance` computes `θ_r = sum_i ratio_ir * ψ_i` at observation level and is therefore not PSU-telescoping: redistributing mass onto the post-period cell would silently change the replicate SE whenever a replicate column's ratios vary within a group (the library accepts arbitrary per-row replicate matrices, not just PSU-aligned ones). The legacy allocator preserves byte-identity of the replicate SE for every previously-supported fit. Replicate + within-group-varying PSU is unreachable by construction (`SurveyDesign` rejects `replicate_weights` combined with explicit `strata/psu/fpc`).
- **Note (survey + bootstrap contract):** When `survey_design` and `n_bootstrap > 0` are both active, the bootstrap uses Hall-Mammen wild multiplier weights (Rademacher/Mammen/Webb) **at the PSU level**. Under the default auto-injected `psu=group`, the PSU coincides with the group so the wild bootstrap is a clean group-level clustered bootstrap (identity-map fast path, bit-identical to the non-survey multiplier bootstrap). When the user passes an explicit strictly-coarser PSU (e.g., `psu=state` with groups at county level), the IF contributions of all groups within a PSU receive the same bootstrap multiplier — the standard Hall-Mammen wild PSU bootstrap. Strata do not participate in the bootstrap randomization (they contribute only through the analytical TSL variance); this is conservative when strata differ substantially in variance. A `UserWarning` fires only when PSU is strictly coarser than group. **Cell-level wild PSU bootstrap under within-group-varying PSU:** when the PSU varies across the cells of a group, the bootstrap switches to a cell-level allocator: each `(g, t)` cell draws its multiplier from `w[psu(cell)]` via the per-cell PSU map `psu_codes_per_cell` (shape `(n_eligible_groups, n_periods)`, -1 sentinel for zero-weight cells). The bootstrap statistic becomes `theta_r = sum_c w[psu(c)] * u_centered_pp[c] / divisor` using the cohort-recentered per-cell IF `U_centered_per_period`. Under PSU-within-group-constant regimes (including PSU=group and strictly-coarser PSU with within-group constancy), the per-cell sum telescopes to the group-level form via the row-sum identity `sum_{c in g} U_centered_per_period[g, t] == U_centered[g]` (enforced by `_cohort_recenter_per_period`). A dispatcher in `_compute_dcdh_bootstrap` detects within-group-constancy and routes those regimes through the legacy group-level bootstrap path so their SE is **bit-identical** to the pre-cell-level release (guarded primarily by `test_bootstrap_se_matches_pre_pr4_baseline` and by the existing `test_auto_inject_bit_identical_to_group_level`). Under within-group-varying PSU, a group contributing cells to PSUs `p1, p2, ...` receives independent multiplier draws per PSU — the correct Hall-Mammen wild PSU clustering at cell granularity. **Multi-horizon bootstraps** draw a single shared `(n_bootstrap, n_psu)` PSU-level weight matrix per block and broadcast per-horizon via each horizon's cell-to-PSU map, so the sup-t simultaneous confidence band remains a valid joint distribution across horizons. **Library extension** — R `DIDmultiplegtDYN` does not support survey designs, so "deviation from R" does not apply. **Scope note (terminal missingness + any cell-period-allocator path):** see the balanced-baseline Note above for the full carve-out. In brief: when a terminally-missing group is in a cohort whose other groups still contribute at the missing period, `_cohort_recenter_per_period` leaks non-zero centered IF mass onto cells with no positive-weight observations. The targeted `ValueError` fires from every survey variance path that uses the cell-period allocator: Binder TSL with within-group-varying PSU, Rao-Wu replicate ATT (which always uses the cell allocator), and the cell-level wild PSU bootstrap. Pre-process the panel to remove terminal missingness, or (for Binder TSL only) use an explicit `psu=<group_col>` so the analytical path routes through the legacy group-level allocator. **Replicate-weight designs and `n_bootstrap > 0` are mutually exclusive** (replicate variance is closed-form; bootstrap would double-count variance) — the combination raises `NotImplementedError`, matching `efficient_did.py:989`, `staggered.py:1869`, `two_stage.py:251-253`. For HonestDiD bounds under replicate weights, the replicate-effective `df_survey = min(resolved_survey.df_survey, min(n_valid_across_sites) - 1)` propagates to t-critical values — capped by the design's QR-rank-based df so a rank-deficient replicate matrix never produces a larger effective df than the design supports. When `resolved_survey.df_survey` is undefined (QR-rank ≤ 1), the effective df stays `None` and all inference fields (including HonestDiD bounds) are NaN — per-site `n_valid` cannot rescue a rank-deficient design.

## ContinuousDiD

**Primary Source:** Callaway, Goodman-Bacon & Sant'Anna (2024), "Difference-in-Differences with a Continuous Treatment," NBER Working Paper 32117.

**R Reference:** `contdid` v0.1.0 (CRAN).

### Identification

Two levels of parallel trends (following CGBS 2024, Assumptions 1-2):

**Parallel Trends (PT):** for all doses d in D_+,
`E[Y_t(0) - Y_{t-1}(0) | D = d] = E[Y_t(0) - Y_{t-1}(0) | D = 0]`.
Untreated potential outcome paths are the same across all dose groups and the
untreated group. Stronger than binary PT because it conditions on specific dose values.
Identifies: `ATT(d|d)`, `ATT^{loc}`. Does NOT identify `ATT(d)`, `ACRT`, or cross-dose comparisons.

**Strong Parallel Trends (SPT):** additionally, for all d in D,
`E[Y_t(d) - Y_{t-1}(0) | D > 0] = E[Y_t(d) - Y_{t-1}(0) | D = d]`.
No selection into dose groups on the basis of treatment effects.
Implies `ATT(d|d) = ATT(d)` for all d.
Additionally identifies: `ATT(d)`, `ACRT(d)`, `ACRT^{glob}`, and cross-dose comparisons.

See `docs/methodology/continuous-did.md` Section 4 for full details.

### Key Equations

**Target parameters:**
- `ATT(d|d) = E[Y_t(d) - Y_t(0) | D = d]` — effect of dose d on units who received dose d (PT)
- `ATT(d) = E[Y_t(d) - Y_t(0) | D > 0]` — dose-response curve (SPT required)
- `ACRT(d) = dATT(d)/dd` — average causal response / marginal effect (SPT required)
- `ATT^{loc} = E[ATT(D|D) | D > 0] = E[Delta Y | D > 0] - E[Delta Y | D = 0]` — binarized ATT (PT); equals `ATT^{glob}` under SPT
- `ATT^{glob} = E[ATT(D) | D > 0]` — global average dose-response level (SPT required)
- `ACRT^{glob} = E[ACRT(D_i) | D > 0]` — plug-in average marginal effect (SPT required)

**Estimation via B-spline OLS:**
1. Compute `Delta_tilde_Y = (Y_t - Y_{t-1})_treated - mean((Y_t - Y_{t-1})_control)`
2. Build B-spline basis `Psi(D_i)` from treated doses
3. OLS: `beta = (Psi'Psi)^{-1} Psi' Delta_tilde_Y`
4. `ATT(d) = Psi(d)' beta`, `ACRT(d) = dPsi(d)/dd' beta`

### Edge Cases

- **No untreated group**: Remark 3.1 (lowest-dose-as-control) not implemented; requires P(D=0) > 0.
- **Discrete treatment**: Detect integer-valued dose and warn; saturated regression deferred.
- **All-same dose**: B-spline basis collapses; ACRT(d) = 0 everywhere.
- **Rank deficiency**: When n_treated <= n_basis, cell is skipped.
- **Balanced panel required**: Matches R `contdid` v0.1.0.
- **Anticipation + not-yet-treated**: Control mask uses `G > t + anticipation`
  (not just `G > t`) to exclude cohorts in the anticipation window from
  not-yet-treated controls. When `anticipation=0` (default), behavior is
  unchanged.
- **Boundary knots**: Knots are built once from all treated doses (global, not per-cell) to ensure a common basis across (g,t) cells for aggregation. Evaluation grid is clamped to training-dose boundary knots (`range(dose)`). R's `contdid` v0.1.0 has an inconsistency where `splines2::bSpline(dvals)` uses `range(dvals)` instead of `range(dose)`, which can produce extrapolation artifacts at dose grid extremes. Our approach avoids extrapolation and is methodologically sound.
- **Note:** `bspline_derivative_design_matrix` previously swallowed `ValueError` from `scipy.interpolate.BSpline` in the per-basis derivative loop, leaving affected columns of the derivative design matrix as zero with no user-facing signal. It now aggregates the failed basis indices and emits ONE `UserWarning` naming them. Both ACRT point estimates and analytical/bootstrap inference read the same `dPsi` matrix (see `continuous_did.py:1026-1046` and the bootstrap ACRT path at `continuous_did.py:1524-1561`), so both are biased on a partial derivative-construction failure — the warning wording makes that explicit. The all-identical-knot degenerate case (single dose value) remains silently handled — derivatives there are mathematically zero. Axis-C finding #12 in the Phase 2 silent-failures audit.

### Implementation Checklist

- [x] B-spline basis construction matching R's `splines2::bSpline` (global knots from all treated doses; boundary knots use training-dose range; see deviation note above)
- [x] Multi-period (g,t) cell iteration with base period selection
- [x] Dose-response and event-study aggregation with group-proportional weights (n_treated/n_total per group, divided among post-treatment cells; R `ptetools` convention)
- [x] Multiplier bootstrap for inference
- [x] Analytical SEs via influence functions
- [x] Equation verification tests (linear, quadratic, multi-period)
- [ ] Covariate support (deferred, matching R v0.1.0)
- [ ] Discrete treatment saturated regression
- [ ] Lowest-dose-as-control (Remark 3.1)
- [x] Survey design support (Phase 3): weighted B-spline OLS, TSL on influence functions; bootstrap+survey supported (Phase 6)
- **Note:** ContinuousDiD bootstrap with survey weights supported (Phase 6) via PSU-level multiplier weights
- **Note:** The R-style convention of coding never-treated units as `first_treat=inf` is still accepted and normalized to `first_treat=0` internally, but the estimator now emits a `UserWarning` reporting the row count so the silent recategorization is surfaced (axis-E silent coercion under the Phase 2 audit). Only `+inf` is recoded (matching the R convention). Any **negative** `first_treat` value (including `-inf`) raises `ValueError` with the row count, since such units would otherwise silently fall out of both the treated (`g > 0`) and never-treated (`g == 0`) masks. Pass `0` directly for never-treated units to avoid the warning.
- **Note:** Rows where `first_treat=0` (never-treated) carry a nonzero `dose` are silently zeroed for internal consistency (never-treated cells must have `D=0` in the dose response). The estimator now emits a `UserWarning` with the affected row count before the zeroing, so unintended nonzero doses on never-treated rows are no longer absorbed without a signal (axis-E silent coercion).

## EfficientDiD

**Primary source:** Chen, X., Sant'Anna, P. H. C., & Xie, H. (2025). Efficient Difference-in-Differences and Event Study Estimators.

**Key implementation requirements:**

*Assumption checks / warnings:*
- **Random Sampling (Assumption S)**: Data is a random sample of `(Y_{1}, ..., Y_{T}, X', G)'`
- **Overlap (Assumption O)**: For each group g, generalized propensity score `E[G_g | X]` must be in `(0, 1)` a.s. Near-zero propensity scores cause ratio `p_g(X)/p_{g'}(X)` to explode; warn on finite-sample instability
- **No-anticipation (Assumption NA)**: For all treated groups g and pre-treatment periods t < g: `E[Y_t(g) | G=g, X] = E[Y_t(infinity) | G=g, X]` a.s.
- **Parallel Trends -- two variants**:
  - **PT-Post** (weaker): PT holds only in post-treatment periods, comparison group = never-treated only, baseline = period g-1 only. Estimator is just-identified and reduces to standard single-baseline DiD (Corollary 3.2)
  - **PT-All** (stronger): PT holds for all groups and all periods. Enables using any not-yet-treated cohort and any pre-treatment period as baseline. Model is overidentified (Lemma 2.1); paper derives optimal combination weights
- **Absorbing treatment**: Binary treatment must be irreversible (once treated, stays treated)
- **Balanced panel**: Short balanced panel required ("large-n, fixed-T" regime). Does not handle unbalanced panels or repeated cross-sections
- Warn if treatment varies within units (non-absorbing treatment)
- Warn if propensity score estimates are near boundary values
- **Note:** Polynomial-sieve propensity fits now reject any K whose normal-equations matrix has condition number above `1/sqrt(eps)` (≈ 6.7e7) — previously a near-singular `np.linalg.solve` could return numerically meaningless coefficients without raising. If at least one K succeeds but others were skipped via this precondition, a `UserWarning` lists the skipped K values. If every K is skipped, the existing "estimation failed for all K values" fallback warning still fires. Axis-A finding #18 in the Phase 2 silent-failures audit.

*Estimator equation -- single treatment date (Equations 3.2, 3.5):*

Transformed outcome (Equation 3.2):
```
Y_tilde_{g,t,t_pre} = (1/pi_g) * (G_g - p_g(X)/p_inf(X) * G_inf) * (Y_t - Y_{t_pre} - m_{inf,t,t_pre}(X))
```

Efficient ATT estimand (Equation 3.5):
```
ATT(g, t) = E[ (1' V*_{gt}(X)^{-1} / (1' V*_{gt}(X)^{-1} 1)) * Y_tilde_{g,t} ]
```

where:
- `G_g = 1{G = g}` = indicator for belonging to treatment cohort g
- `G_inf = 1{G = infinity}` = indicator for never-treated
- `pi_g = P(G = g)` = population share of cohort g
- `p_g(X) = E[G_g | X]` = generalized propensity score
- `m_{inf,t,t_pre}(X) = E[Y_t - Y_{t_pre} | G = infinity, X]` = conditional mean outcome change for never-treated
- `V*_{gt}(X)` = `(g-1) x (g-1)` conditional covariance matrix with `(j,k)`-th element (Equation 3.4):
  ```
  (1/p_g(X)) Cov(Y_t - Y_j, Y_t - Y_k | G=g, X) + (1/(1-p_g(X))) Cov(Y_t - Y_j, Y_t - Y_k | G=inf, X)
  ```

*Estimator equation -- staggered adoption (Equations 3.9, 3.13, 4.3, 4.4):*

Generated outcome for each `(g', t_pre)` pair (Equation 3.9 / sample analog 4.4):
```
Y_hat^{att(g,t)}_{g',t_pre} = (G_g / pi_hat_g) * (Y_t - Y_1 - m_hat_{inf,t,t_pre}(X) - m_hat_{g',t_pre,1}(X))
    - r_hat_{g,inf}(X) * (G_inf / pi_hat_g) * (Y_t - Y_{t_pre} - m_hat_{inf,t,t_pre}(X))
    - r_hat_{g,g'}(X) * (G_{g'} / pi_hat_g) * (Y_{t_pre} - Y_1 - m_hat_{g',t_pre,1}(X))
```

where:
- `r_hat_{g,g'}(X) = p_g(X)/p_{g'}(X)` = estimated propensity score ratio
- `m_hat_{g',t,t_pre}(X) = E[Y_t - Y_{t_pre} | G = g', X]` = estimated conditional mean outcome change

Efficient ATT for staggered adoption (Equation 4.3):
```
ATT_hat_stg(g,t) = E_n[ (1' Omega_hat*_{gt}(X)^{-1}) / (1' Omega_hat*_{gt}(X)^{-1} 1) * Y_hat^{att(g,t)}_stg ]
```

where `Omega*_{gt}(X)` is the conditional covariance matrix with `(j,k)`-th element (Equation 3.12):
```
(1/p_g(X)) Cov(Y_t - Y_1, Y_t - Y_1 | G=g, X)
+ (1/p_inf(X)) Cov(Y_t - Y_{t'_j}, Y_t - Y_{t'_k} | G=inf, X)
- 1{g=g'_j}/p_g(X) * Cov(Y_t - Y_1, Y_{t'_j} - Y_1 | G=g, X)
- 1{g=g'_k}/p_g(X) * Cov(Y_t - Y_1, Y_{t'_k} - Y_1 | G=g, X)
+ 1{g_j=g'_k}/p_{g'_j}(X) * Cov(Y_{t'_j} - Y_1, Y_{t'_k} - Y_1 | G=g'_j, X)
```

*Event study aggregation (Equations 3.8, 3.14, 4.5):*

```
ES_hat(e) = sum_{g in G_{trt,e}}  (pi_hat_g / sum_{g' in G_{trt,e}} pi_hat_{g'})  * ATT_hat_stg(g, g+e)
```

where `G_{trt,e} = {g in G_trt : g + e <= T}` and weights are cohort relative size weights.

Overall average event-study parameter (Equation 2.3):
```
ES_avg = (1/N_E) * sum_{e in E} ES(e)
```

*With covariates / doubly robust:*

The estimator is doubly robust by construction. Consistency requires correct specification of either:
- Outcome regression: `m_{g',t,t_pre}(X) = E[Y_t - Y_{t_pre} | G = g', X]`, OR
- Propensity score ratio: `r_{g,g'}(X) = p_g(X)/p_{g'}(X)`

The Neyman orthogonality property (Remark 4.2) permits modern ML estimators (random forests, lasso, ridge, neural nets, boosted trees) for nuisance parameters without loss of efficiency.

*Without covariates (Section 4.1):*

Estimator simplifies to closed-form expressions using only within-group sample means and sample covariances. **No tuning parameters** are needed. The covariance matrix `Omega*_gt` uses unconditional within-group covariances with `pi_g` replacing `p_g(X)`.

*Standard errors (Theorem 4.1, Section 4):*
- Default: Analytical SE computed as the square root of the sample variance of estimated EIF values divided by n:
  ```
  SE_analytical = sqrt( (1/n^2) * sum_{i=1}^{n} EIF_hat_i^2 )
  ```
- Alternative: Cluster-robust SE at cross-sectional unit level (used in empirical application, page 34-35)
- Bootstrap: Nonparametric clustered bootstrap (resampling clusters with replacement); 300 replications recommended (page 23, footnote 16)
- **Small sample recommendation** (Section 5.1): Use cluster bootstrap SEs rather than analytical SEs when n is small (n <= 50). Analytical SEs are anticonservative with n=50 (coverage ~0.80) but perform well with n >= 200 (coverage ~0.94)
- Simultaneous confidence bands: Multiplier bootstrap procedure for multiple `(g,t)` pairs (footnote 13, referencing Callaway and Sant'Anna 2021, Theorems 2-3, Algorithm 1)
- **Implementation note**: Phase 1 uses multiplier bootstrap on EIF values (Rademacher/Mammen/Webb weights) rather than nonparametric clustered bootstrap. This is asymptotically equivalent and computationally cheaper, consistent with the CallawaySantAnna implementation pattern. Clustered resampling bootstrap may be added in a future version

*Efficient influence function for ATT(g,t) (Theorem 3.2):*
```
EIF^{att(g,t)}_stg = (1' Omega*_{gt}(X)^{-1}) / (1' Omega*_{gt}(X)^{-1} 1) * IF^{att(g,t)}_stg
```

*Efficient influence function for ES(e) (following Theorem 3.2, page 17):*
```
EIF^{es(e)}_stg = sum_{g in G_{trt,e}} ( q_{g,e} * EIF^{att(g,g+e)}_stg
    + ATT(g,g+e) / (sum_{g' in G_{trt,e}} pi_{g'}) * (G_g - pi_g)
    - q_{g,e} * sum_{s in G_{trt,e}} (G_s - pi_s) )
```
where `q_{g,e} = pi_g / sum_{g' in G_{trt,e}} pi_{g'}`.

*Edge cases:*
- **Single pre-treatment period (g=2)**: `V*_{gt}(X)` is 1x1, efficient weights are trivially 1, estimator collapses to standard DiD with single baseline
- **Rank deficiency in `V*_{gt}(X)` or `Omega*_{gt}(X)`**: Inverse does not exist if outcome changes are linearly dependent conditional on covariates. Detect via matrix condition number; fall back to pseudoinverse or standard estimator
- **Near-zero propensity scores**: Ratio `p_g(X)/p_{g'}(X)` explodes. Overlap assumption (O) rules this out in population; implement trimming or warn on finite-sample instability
- **Note:** When no sieve degree K succeeds for ratio estimation (basis dimension exceeds comparison group size, or all linear systems are singular), the estimator falls back to a constant ratio of 1 for all units with a UserWarning. The outcome regression adjustment remains active, so the generated outcomes (Eq 4.4) still incorporate covariate information via the m_hat terms. The DR property ensures consistency as long as the outcome regression is correctly specified.
- **Note:** When no sieve degree K succeeds for inverse propensity estimation (algorithm step 4), the estimator falls back to unconditional n/n_group scaling with a UserWarning, which reduces to the unconditional Omega* approximation for the affected group.
- **All units eventually treated**: Last cohort serves as "never-treated" by dropping time periods from the last cohort's treatment onset onward. Use `control_group="last_cohort"` to enable; default `"never_treated"` raises ValueError if no never-treated units exist
- **Negative weights**: Explicitly stated as harmless for bias and beneficial for precision; arise from efficiency optimization under overidentification (Section 5.2)
- **PT-Post regime (just-identified)**: Under PT-Post, EDiD automatically reduces to standard single-baseline estimator (Corollary 3.2). No downside to using EDiD -- it subsumes standard estimators
- **Duplicate rows**: Duplicate `(unit, time)` entries are rejected with `ValueError`. The estimator requires exactly one observation per unit-period
- **Note:** PT-All index set includes g'=∞ (never-treated) as a candidate comparison group and excludes period_1 for all g'. When g'=∞, the second and third Eq 3.9 terms telescope so all (∞, t_pre) moments produce the same 2x2 DiD value; these redundant moments are handled by Omega*'s pseudoinverse. When t_pre = period_1, the third term degenerates to E[Y_1 - Y_1 | G=g'] = 0 for any g', adding no information. Valid pairs require only t_pre < g' (pre-treatment for comparison group), not t_pre < g. Same-group pairs (g'=g) are valid and contribute overidentifying moments (Equation 3.9).
- **Note:** Bootstrap aggregation uses fixed cohort-size weights for overall/event-study reaggregation, matching the CallawaySantAnna bootstrap pattern (staggered_bootstrap.py:281 computes `bootstrap_overall = bootstrap_atts_gt[:, post_indices] @ weights`; L297 uses the same fixed-weight pattern for event study). The analytical path includes a WIF correction; fixed-weight bootstrap captures the same sampling variability through per-cell EIF perturbation without re-estimating aggregation weights, consistent with both the library's CS implementation and the R `did` package.
- **Overall ATT convention**: The library's `overall_att` uses cohort-size-weighted averaging of post-treatment (g,t) cells, matching the CallawaySantAnna simple aggregation. This differs from the paper's ES_avg (Eq 2.3), which uniformly averages over event-time horizons. ES_avg can be computed from event study output as `mean(event_study_effects[e]["effect"] for e >= 0)`

*Algorithm (two-step semiparametric estimation, Section 4):*

**Step 1: Estimate nuisance parameters**
1. Estimate outcome regressions `m_hat_{g',t,t_pre}(X)` using sieve regression, kernel smoothing, or ML methods (for each valid `(g', t_pre)` pair)
2. Estimate propensity score ratios `r_hat_{g,g'}(X) = p_g(X)/p_{g'}(X)` via convex minimization (Equation 4.1):
   ```
   r_{g,g'}(X) = arg min_{r} E[ r(X)^2 * G_{g'} - 2*r(X)*G_g ]
   ```
   Sieve estimator (Equation 4.2): `beta_hat_K = arg min_{beta_K} E_n[ G_{g'} * (psi^K(X)' beta_K)^2 - 2*G_g * (psi^K(X)' beta_K) ]`
3. Select sieve index K via information criterion: `K_hat = arg min_K { 2*loss(K) + C_n * K / n }` where `C_n = 2` (AIC) or `C_n = log(n)` (BIC)
4. Estimate `s_hat_{g'}(X) = 1/p_{g'}(X)` via analogous convex minimization
5. Estimate conditional covariance `Omega_hat*_{gt}(X)` using kernel smoothing with bandwidth h

**Step 2: Construct efficient estimator**
6. Compute generated outcomes `Y_hat^{att(g,t)}_{g',t_pre}` for each valid `(g', t_pre)` pair using Equation 4.4
7. Compute efficient weights `w(X) = 1' Omega_hat*_{gt}(X)^{-1} / (1' Omega_hat*_{gt}(X)^{-1} 1)`
8. Compute `ATT_hat_stg(g,t) = E_n[ w(X_i) * Y_hat^{att(g,t)}_stg ]` (Equation 4.3)
9. Aggregate to event-study: `ES_hat(e) = sum_g (pi_hat_g / sum pi_hat) * ATT_hat_stg(g, g+e)` (Equation 4.5)
10. Compute SE from sample variance of estimated EIF values

**Without covariates**: Steps 1-5 simplify to within-group sample means and sample covariances. No nuisance estimation or tuning needed.

**Reference implementation(s):**
- No specific software package named in the paper for the EDiD estimator
- Estimators compared against: Callaway-Sant'Anna (`did` R package), de Chaisemartin-D'Haultfoeuille (`DIDmultiplegt` R package / `did_multiplegt` Stata), Borusyak-Jaravel-Spiess / Gardner / Wooldridge imputation estimators
- Empirical replication: HRS data from Dobkin et al. (2018) following Sun and Abraham (2021) sample selection

**Requirements checklist:**
- [x] Implements two-step semiparametric estimator (Equation 4.3)
- [x] Supports both PT-Post (just-identified) and PT-All (overidentified) regimes
- [x] Computes efficient weights from conditional covariance matrix inverse
- [x] Doubly robust: consistent if either outcome regression or propensity score ratio is correct
- [x] No-covariates case uses closed-form sample means/covariances (no tuning)
- [x] With covariates: sieve-based propensity ratio estimation with AIC/BIC selection
- [x] Kernel-smoothed conditional covariance estimation
- [x] Analytical SE from EIF sample variance
- [x] Cluster-robust SE option (analytical from EIF + cluster-level multiplier bootstrap)
- [x] Event-study aggregation ES(e) with cohort-size weights
- [x] Hausman-type pre-test for PT-All vs PT-Post (Theorem A.1)
- [x] Each ATT(g,t) can be estimated independently (parallelizable)
- [x] Absorbing treatment validation
- [x] Overlap diagnostics for propensity score ratios
- [x] Survey design support (Phase 3): survey-weighted means/covariances in Omega*, TSL on EIF scores; bootstrap+survey supported (Phase 6)
- **Note:** Sieve ratio estimation uses polynomial basis functions (total degree up to K) with AIC/BIC model selection. The paper describes sieve estimators generally without specifying a particular basis family; polynomial sieves are a standard choice (Section 4, Eq 4.2). Negative sieve ratio predictions are clipped to a small positive value since the population ratio p_g(X)/p_{g'}(X) is non-negative.
- **Note:** Kernel-smoothed conditional covariance Omega*(X) uses Gaussian kernel with Silverman's rule-of-thumb bandwidth by default. The paper specifies kernel smoothing (step 5, Section 4) without mandating a particular kernel or bandwidth selection method.
- **Note:** Conditional covariance Omega*(X) scales each term by per-unit sieve-estimated inverse propensities s_hat_{g'}(X) = 1/p_{g'}(X) (algorithm step 4), matching Eq 3.12. The inverse propensity estimation uses the same polynomial sieve convex minimization as the ratio estimator. Estimated s_hat values are clipped to [1, n] with a UserWarning when clipping binds, mirroring the ratio path's overlap diagnostics.
- **Note:** Outcome regressions m_hat_{g',t,tpre}(X) use linear OLS working models. The paper's Section 4 describes flexible nonparametric nuisance estimation (sieve regression, kernel smoothing, or ML methods). The DR property ensures consistency if either the OLS outcome model or the sieve propensity ratio is correctly specified, but the linear OLS specification does not generically guarantee attainment of the semiparametric efficiency bound unless the conditional mean is linear in the covariates.
- **Note:** EfficientDiD bootstrap with survey weights supported (Phase 6) via PSU-level multiplier weights
- **Note:** EfficientDiD covariates (DR path) with survey weights supported — WLS outcome regression, weighted sieve normal equations for propensity ratios/inverse propensities, survey-weighted Nadaraya-Watson kernel for conditional Omega*(X), and survey-weighted ATT averaging. Silverman bandwidth uses unweighted statistics (survey-weighted bandwidth deferred as second-order refinement).
- **Note:** Cluster-robust SEs use the standard Liang-Zeger clustered sandwich estimator applied to EIF values: aggregate EIF within clusters, center, and compute variance with G/(G-1) small-sample correction. Cluster bootstrap generates multiplier weights at the cluster level (all units in a cluster share the same weight). Analytical clustered SEs are the default when `cluster` is set; cluster bootstrap is opt-in via `n_bootstrap > 0`.
- **Note:** Hausman pretest operates on the post-treatment event-study vector ES(e) per Theorem A.1. Both PT-All and PT-Post fits are aggregated to ES(e) using cohort-size weights before computing the test statistic H = delta' V^{-1} delta where delta = ES_post - ES_all and V = Cov(ES_post) - Cov(ES_all). Covariance is computed from aggregated ES(e)-level EIF values. The variance-difference matrix V is inverted via Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse to handle finite-sample non-positive-definiteness. Effective rank of V (number of positive eigenvalues) is used as degrees of freedom.
- **Note:** Last-cohort-as-control (`control_group="last_cohort"`) reclassifies the latest treatment cohort as pseudo-never-treated and drops time periods at/after that cohort's treatment start. This is distinct from CallawaySantAnna's `not_yet_treated` option which dynamically selects not-yet-treated units per (g,t) pair.

**Key implementation requirements:**

*Assumption checks / warnings:*
- Requires never-treated units as control group
- Warns if treatment effects may be heterogeneous across cohorts (which the method handles)
- Reference period: e=-1-anticipation (defaults to e=-1 when anticipation=0)

*Estimator equation (as implemented):*

Saturated regression with cohort-specific effects:
```
Y_it = α_i + γ_t + Σ_{g∈G} Σ_{e≠-1} δ_{g,e} × 1(G_i=g) × D^e_{it} + ε_it
```
where G_i is unit i's cohort (first treatment period), D^e_{it} = 1(t - G_i = e).

Interaction-weighted estimator:
```
δ̂_e = Σ_g ŵ_{g,e} × δ̂_{g,e}
```
where weights ŵ_{g,e} = n_{g,e} / Σ_g n_{g,e} (sample share of cohort g at event-time e).

*Standard errors:*
- Default: Cluster-robust at unit level
- Delta method for aggregated coefficients
- Optional: Pairs bootstrap for robustness

*Edge cases:*
- Single cohort: reduces to standard event study
- Cohorts with no observations at some event-times: weighted appropriately
- Extrapolation beyond observed event-times: not estimated
- Event-time range: no artificial cap (estimates all available relative times, matching R's `fixest::sunab()`)
- No post-treatment effects: returns `(NaN, NaN)` for overall ATT/SE; all inference fields (t_stat, p_value, conf_int) propagate NaN via `np.isfinite()` guards
- `min_pre_periods`/`min_post_periods` parameters: removed (previously deprecated with `FutureWarning`; callers passing these will now get `TypeError`)
- Variance fallback: when full weight vector cannot be constructed for overall ATT SE, uses simplified variance (ignores covariances between periods) with `UserWarning`
- Rank-deficient design matrix (covariate collinearity):
  - Detection: Pivoted QR decomposition with tolerance `1e-07` (R's `qr()` default)
  - Handling: Warns and drops linearly dependent columns, sets NA for dropped coefficients (R-style, matches `lm()`)
  - Parameter: `rank_deficient_action` controls behavior: "warn" (default), "error", or "silent"
- NaN inference for undefined statistics:
  - t_stat: Uses NaN (not 0.0) when SE is non-finite or zero
  - Analytical inference: p_value and CI also NaN when t_stat is NaN (NaN propagates through `compute_p_value` and `compute_confidence_interval`)
  - Bootstrap inference: p_value and CI computed from bootstrap distribution. SE, CI, and p-value are all NaN if the original point estimate is non-finite, SE is non-finite or zero, or if <50% of bootstrap samples are valid
  - Applies to overall ATT, per-effect event study, and aggregated event study
  - **Note**: Defensive enhancement matching CallawaySantAnna behavior; R's `fixest::sunab()` may produce Inf/NaN without warning
- Inference distribution:
  - Cohort-level p-values: t-distribution (via `LinearRegression.get_inference()`)
  - Aggregated event study and overall ATT p-values: normal distribution (via `compute_p_value()`)
  - This is asymptotically equivalent and standard for delta-method-aggregated quantities
  - **Deviation from R**: R's fixest uses t-distribution at all levels; aggregated p-values may differ slightly for small samples

**Reference implementation(s):**
- R: `fixest::sunab()` (Laurent Bergé's implementation)
- Stata: `eventstudyinteract`

**Requirements checklist:**
- [x] Never-treated units required as controls
- [x] Interaction weights sum to 1 within each relative time period
- [x] Reference period defaults to e=-1, coefficient normalized to zero
- [x] Cohort-specific effects recoverable from results
- [x] Cluster-robust SEs with delta method for aggregates
- [x] R comparison: ATT matches within machine precision (<1e-11)
- [x] R comparison: SE matches within 0.3% (well within 1% threshold)
- [x] R comparison: Event study effects match perfectly (correlation 1.0)
- [x] Survey design support (Phase 3): weighted within-transform, survey weights in LinearRegression with TSL vcov; bootstrap+survey supported (Phase 6) via Rao-Wu rescaled bootstrap. Replicate weights supported via estimator-level refit (see Replicate Weight Variance section); replicate+bootstrap rejected.

**Key implementation requirements:**

*Assumption checks / warnings:*
- **Parallel trends (Assumption 1):** `E[Y_it(0)] = alpha_i + beta_t` for all observations. General form allows `E[Y_it(0)] = alpha_i + beta_t + X'_it * delta` with time-varying covariates.
- **No-anticipation effects (Assumption 2):** `Y_it = Y_it(0)` for all untreated observations. Adjustable via `anticipation` parameter.
- Treatment must be absorbing: `D_it` switches from 0 to 1 and stays at 1.
- Covariate space of treated observations must be spanned by untreated observations (rank condition). For unit/period FE case: every treated unit must have ≥1 untreated period; every post-treatment period must have ≥1 untreated unit.
- Without never-treated units, long-run effects at horizon `K_it >= H_bar` (where `H_bar = max(first_treat) - min(first_treat)`) are not identified (Proposition 5). Set to NaN with warning.

*Estimator equation (Theorem 2, as implemented):*

```
Step 1. Estimate counterfactual model on untreated observations only (it in Omega_0):
    Y_it = alpha_i + beta_t [+ X'_it * delta] + epsilon_it

Step 2. For each treated observation (it in Omega_1), impute:
    Y_hat_it(0) = alpha_hat_i + beta_hat_t [+ X'_it * delta_hat]
    tau_hat_it  = Y_it - Y_hat_it(0)

Step 3. Aggregate:
    tau_hat_w = sum_{it in Omega_1} w_it * tau_hat_it
```

where:
- `Omega_0 = {it : D_it = 0}` — all untreated observations (never-treated + not-yet-treated)
- `Omega_1 = {it : D_it = 1}` — all treated observations
- `w_it` = pre-specified weights (overall ATT: `w_it = 1/N_1`)

*Common estimation targets (weighting schemes):*
- Overall ATT: `w_it = 1/N_1` for all `it in Omega_1`
- Horizon-specific: `w_it = 1[K_it = h] / |Omega_{1,h}|` for `K_it = t - E_i`
- Group-specific: `w_it = 1[G_i = g] / |Omega_{1,g}|`

*Standard errors (Theorem 3, Equation 7):*

Conservative clustered variance estimator:
```
sigma_hat^2_w = sum_i ( sum_{t: it in Omega} v_it * epsilon_tilde_it )^2
```

Observation weights `v_it`:
- For treated `(i,t) in Omega_1`: `v_it = w_it` (the aggregation weight)
- For untreated `(i,t) in Omega_0` (FE-only case): `v_it = -(w_i./n_{0,i} + w_.t/n_{0,t} - w../N_0)`
  where `w_i. = sum of w over treated obs of unit i`, `n_{0,i} = untreated periods for unit i`, etc.
- For untreated with covariates: `v_untreated = -A_0 (A_0' A_0)^{-1} A_1' w_treated`
  where `A_0`, `A_1` are design matrices for untreated/treated observations.

**Note on v_it derivation:** The paper's Supplementary Proposition A3 provides the explicit formula for `v_it^*`, but was not in the extraction range for the paper review. The FE-only closed form above is reconstructed from Theorem 3's general form — it follows from the chain rule of the imputation estimator's dependence on the Step 1 OLS estimates. The covariate case uses the OLS projection matrix directly.

Auxiliary model residuals (Equation 8):
- Partition `Omega_1` into groups `G_g` (default: cohort × horizon)
- Compute `tau_tilde_g` for each group (weighted average within group)
- `epsilon_tilde_it = Y_it - alpha_hat_i - beta_hat_t [- X'delta_hat] - tau_tilde_g` (treated)
- `epsilon_tilde_it = Y_it - alpha_hat_i - beta_hat_t [- X'delta_hat]` (untreated, i.e., Step 1 residuals)

The `aux_partition` parameter controls the partition: `"cohort_horizon"` (default, tightest SEs), `"cohort"` (coarser, more conservative), `"horizon"` (groups by relative time only).

*Pre-trend test (Test 1, Equation 9):*
```
Y_it = alpha_i + beta_t [+ X'_it * delta] + W'_it * gamma + epsilon_it
```
- Estimate on untreated observations only
- Test `gamma = 0` via cluster-robust Wald F-test
- Independent of treatment effect estimation (Proposition 9)

*Pre-period event study coefficients (`pretrends=True`, Test 1 / Equation 9):*

Pre-period coefficients reuse the existing pre-trend test machinery (BJS Equation 9):
```
Y_it = alpha_i + beta_t [+ X'_it * delta] + sum_h gamma_h * W_it(h) + epsilon_it
```
where `W_it(h) = 1[K_it = h]` are lead indicators, estimated on `Omega_0` only.
- `gamma_h` are the pre-period event study coefficients (cluster-robust SEs by default; design-based survey VCV when analytical `survey_design` is present)
- Under parallel trends (Assumption 1), `gamma_h = 0` for all `h < -anticipation`
- Reference period `h = -1 - anticipation` is the omitted category (normalized to zero)
- SEs from cluster-robust Wald variance by default; design-based when survey present (consistent with `pretrend_test()`)
- Bootstrap does not update pre-period SEs (they are from the lead regression)
- When `balance_e` is set, lead indicators are restricted to balanced cohorts; the full Omega_0 sample (including never-treated) is kept for within-transformation
- Only affects event study aggregation; overall ATT and group aggregation unchanged
- **Note:** `pretrends=True` with analytical `survey_design` (strata/PSU/FPC) is supported. The lead regression uses survey-weighted demeaning, WLS point estimates, and `compute_survey_vcov()` for design-based VCV. The full survey design is preserved (subpopulation approach): Omega_0 scores are zero-padded back to full-panel length so PSU/strata structure is maintained for variance estimation. The F-test in `pretrend_test()` uses the full-design `df_survey` as denominator df. Replicate-weight survey designs raise `NotImplementedError` with `pretrends=True` because per-replicate lead regression refits are not yet implemented.

*Edge cases:*
- **Unbalanced panels:** FE estimated via iterative alternating projection (Gauss-Seidel), equivalent to OLS with unit+time dummies. Converges in O(max_iter) passes; typically 5-20 iterations for unbalanced panels, 1-2 for balanced. One-pass demeaning is only exact for balanced panels.
- **No never-treated units (Proposition 5):** Long-run effects at horizons `h >= H_bar` are not identified. Set to NaN with warning listing affected horizons.
- **Rank condition failure:** Every treated unit must have ≥1 untreated period; every post-treatment period must have ≥1 untreated unit. Behavior controlled by `rank_deficient_action`: "warn" (default), "error", or "silent". Missing FE produce NaN treatment effects for affected observations.
- **Always-treated units:** Units with `first_treat` at or before the earliest time period have no untreated observations. Warning emitted; these units are excluded from Step 1 OLS but their treated observations contribute to aggregation if imputation is possible.
- **NaN propagation:** If all `tau_hat` values for a given horizon or group are NaN, the aggregated effect and all inference fields (SE, t-stat, p-value, CI) are set to NaN. NaN in v*eps product (from missing FE) is zeroed for variance computation (matching R's did_imputation which drops unimputable obs).
- **NaN inference for undefined statistics:** t_stat uses NaN when SE is non-finite or zero; p_value and CI also NaN. Matches CallawaySantAnna NaN convention.
- **Pre-trend test:** Uses iterative demeaning (same as Step 1 FE) for exact within-transformation on unbalanced panels. One-pass demeaning is only exact for balanced panels.
- **Overall ATT variance:** Weights zero out non-finite tau_hat and renormalize, matching the ATT estimand (which averages only finite tau_hat). `_compute_conservative_variance` returns 0.0 for all-zeros weights, so the n_valid==0 guard is necessary to return NaN SE.
- **`balance_e` cohort filtering:** When `balance_e` is set, cohort balance is checked against the *full panel* (pre + post treatment) via `_build_cohort_rel_times()`, requiring observations at every relative time in `[-balance_e, max_h]`. Both analytical aggregation and bootstrap inference use the same `_compute_balanced_cohort_mask` with pre-computed cohort horizons.
- **Bootstrap clustering:** Multiplier bootstrap generates weights at `cluster_var` granularity (defaults to `unit` if `cluster` not specified). Invalid cluster column raises ValueError.
- **Non-constant `first_treat` within a unit:** Emits `UserWarning` identifying the count and example unit. The estimator proceeds using the first observed value per unit (via `.first()` aggregation), but results may be unreliable.
- **treatment_effects DataFrame weights:** `weight` column uses `1/n_valid` for finite tau_hat and 0 for NaN tau_hat, consistent with the ATT estimand (unweighted), or normalized survey weights `sw_i/sum(sw)` when `survey_design` is active.
- **Rank-deficient covariates in variance:** Covariates with NaN coefficients (dropped for rank deficiency in Step 1) are excluded from the variance design matrices `A_0`/`A_1`. Only covariates with finite coefficients participate in the `v_it` projection.
- **Sparse variance solver:** `_compute_v_untreated_with_covariates` uses `scipy.sparse.linalg.spsolve` to solve `(A_0'A_0) z = A_1'w` without densifying the normal equations matrix. Falls back to dense `lstsq` if the sparse solver fails and emits a `UserWarning` on the fallback (silent-failure audit axis C) so callers know variance estimates came from the degraded path.
- **Note:** Survey weights enter ImputationDiD via weighted iterative FE (Step 1), survey-weighted ATT aggregation (Step 3), and design-based variance via `compute_survey_if_variance()`. PSU clustering, stratification, and FPC are fully supported in the Theorem 3 variance path. When `resolved_survey` is present, the observation-level influence function (`v_it * epsilon_tilde_it`) is passed to `compute_survey_if_variance()` which applies the stratified PSU-level sandwich with FPC correction. Strata also enters survey df (n_PSU - n_strata) for t-distribution inference. Bootstrap + survey supported (Phase 6) via PSU-level multiplier weights.
- **Bootstrap inference:** Uses multiplier bootstrap on the Theorem 3 influence function: `psi_i = sum_t v_it * epsilon_tilde_it`. Cluster-level psi sums are pre-computed for each aggregation target (overall, per-horizon, per-group), then perturbed with multiplier weights (Rademacher by default; configurable via `bootstrap_weights` parameter to use Mammen or Webb weights, matching CallawaySantAnna). This is a library extension (not in the paper) consistent with CallawaySantAnna/SunAbraham bootstrap patterns.
- **Auxiliary residuals (Equation 8):** Uses v_it-weighted tau_tilde_g formula: `tau_tilde_g = sum(v_it * tau_hat_it) / sum(v_it)` within each partition group. Zero-weight groups (common in event-study SE computation) fall back to unweighted mean.
- **Note:** Both the iterative FE solver (`_iterative_fe`, Step 1) and the iterative alternating-projection demeaning helper (`_iterative_demean`, used in covariate residualization and the pre-trend test) emit `UserWarning` when `max_iter` exhausts without reaching `tol`, via `diff_diff.utils.warn_if_not_converged`. Silent return of the current iterate was classified as a silent failure under the Phase 2 audit and replaced with an explicit signal to match the logistic/Poisson IRLS pattern in `linalg.py`.

## TwoStageDiD

**Primary source:** [Gardner, J. (2022). Two-stage differences in differences. arXiv:2207.05943.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05943)

**Key implementation requirements:**

*Assumption checks / warnings:*
- **Parallel trends (same as ImputationDiD):** `E[Y_it(0)] = alpha_i + beta_t` for all observations.
- **No-anticipation effects:** `Y_it = Y_it(0)` for all untreated observations.
- Treatment must be absorbing: `D_it` switches from 0 to 1 and stays at 1.
- Always-treated units (treated in all periods) are excluded with a warning, since they have no untreated observations for Stage 1 FE estimation.

*Estimator equation (two-stage procedure, as implemented):*

```
Stage 1. Estimate unit + time fixed effects on untreated observations only (it in Omega_0):
    Y_it = alpha_i + beta_t + epsilon_it
    Compute residuals: y_tilde_it = Y_it - alpha_hat_i - beta_hat_t  (for ALL observations)

Stage 2. Regress residualized outcomes on treatment indicators (on treated observations):
    y_tilde_it = tau * D_it + eta_it
    (or event-study specification with horizon indicators)
```

Point estimates are identical to ImputationDiD (Borusyak et al. 2024). The two-stage procedure is algebraically equivalent to the imputation approach: both estimate unit+time FE on untreated observations and recover treatment effects from the difference between observed and counterfactual outcomes.

*Variance: GMM sandwich (Newey & McFadden 1994 Theorem 6.1):*

The variance accounts for first-stage estimation error propagating into Stage 2, following the GMM framework:

```
V(tau_hat) = (D'D)^{-1} * Bread * (D'D)^{-1}

Bread = sum_c ( sum_{i in c} psi_i )( sum_{i in c} psi_i )'
```

where `psi_i` is the stacked influence function for unit i across all its observations, combining the Stage 2 score and the Stage 1 correction term.

**Note on Equation 6 discrepancy:** The paper's Equation 6 uses a per-cluster inverse `(D_c'D_c)^{-1}` when forming the influence function contribution. The R `did2s` implementation and our code use the GLOBAL inverse `(D'D)^{-1}` following standard GMM theory (Newey & McFadden 1994). We follow the R implementation, which is consistent with standard GMM sandwich variance estimation.

**No finite-sample adjustments:** The variance estimator uses the raw asymptotic sandwich without degrees-of-freedom corrections (no HC1-style `n/(n-k)` adjustment). This matches the R `did2s` implementation.

*Bootstrap:*

Our implementation uses multiplier bootstrap on the GMM influence function: cluster-level `psi` sums are pre-computed, then perturbed with multiplier weights (Rademacher by default; configurable via `bootstrap_weights` parameter to use Mammen or Webb weights, matching CallawaySantAnna). The R `did2s` package defaults to block bootstrap (resampling clusters with replacement). Both approaches are asymptotically valid; the multiplier bootstrap is computationally cheaper and consistent with the CallawaySantAnna/ImputationDiD bootstrap patterns in this library.

*Edge cases:*
- **Always-treated units:** Units treated in all observed periods have no untreated observations for Stage 1 FE estimation. These are excluded with a warning listing the affected unit IDs. Their treated observations do NOT contribute to Stage 2.
- **Rank condition violations:** If the Stage 1 design matrix (unit+time dummies on untreated obs) is rank-deficient, or if certain unit/time FE are unidentified (e.g., a unit with no untreated periods after excluding always-treated), the affected FE produce NaN. Behavior controlled by `rank_deficient_action`: "warn" (default), "error", or "silent".
- **NaN y_tilde handling:** When Stage 1 FE are unidentified for some observations, the residualized outcome `y_tilde` is NaN. These observations are zeroed out (excluded) from the Stage 2 regression and variance computation, matching the treatment of unimputable observations in ImputationDiD.
- **NaN inference for undefined statistics:** t_stat uses NaN when SE is non-finite or zero; p_value and CI also NaN. Matches CallawaySantAnna/ImputationDiD NaN convention.
- **Event study aggregation:** Horizon-specific effects use the same two-stage procedure with horizon indicator dummies in Stage 2. Unidentified horizons (e.g., long-run effects without never-treated units, per Proposition 5 of Borusyak et al. 2024) produce NaN.
- **Pre-period event study coefficients (`pretrends=True`):** When enabled, the Stage 2 design matrix `X_2` includes pre-period relative-time dummies. Pre-period observations have `y_tilde = Step 1 residual` by construction. The GMM sandwich variance accounts for Stage 1 estimation error (Gardner 2022, Theorem 1). Only affects event study aggregation; overall ATT unchanged.
- **balance_e with no qualifying cohorts:** If no cohorts have sufficient pre/post coverage for the requested `balance_e`, a warning is emitted and event study results contain only the reference period.
- **No never-treated units (Proposition 5):** When there are no never-treated units and multiple treatment cohorts, horizons h >= h_bar (where h_bar = max(groups) - min(groups)) are unidentified per Proposition 5 of Borusyak et al. (2024). These produce NaN inference with n_obs > 0 (treated observations exist but counterfactual is unidentified) and a warning listing affected horizons. Matches ImputationDiD behavior. Proposition 5 applies to event study horizons only, not cohort aggregation — a cohort whose treated obs all fall at Prop 5 horizons naturally gets n_obs=0 in group effects because all its y_tilde values are NaN.
- **Zero-observation horizons after filtering:** When `balance_e` or NaN `y_tilde` filtering results in zero observations for some non-Prop-5 event study horizons, those horizons produce NaN for all inference fields (effect, SE, t-stat, p-value, CI) with n_obs=0.
- **Zero-observation cohorts in group effects:** If all treated observations for a cohort have NaN `y_tilde` (excluded from estimation), that cohort's group effect is NaN with n_obs=0.
- **Note:** Survey weights in TwoStageDiD GMM sandwich via weighted cross-products: bread uses (X'_2 W X_2)^{-1}, gamma_hat uses (X'_{10} W X_{10})^{-1}(X'_1 W X_2), per-cluster scores multiply by survey weights. PSU clustering, stratification, and FPC are fully supported in the meat matrix via `_compute_stratified_meat_from_psu_scores()`. When strata or FPC are present, the meat computation replaces `S' S` with the stratified formula `sum_h (1 - f_h) * (n_h/(n_h-1)) * centered_h' centered_h`. Strata also enters survey df (n_PSU - n_strata) for t-distribution inference. Bootstrap + survey supported (Phase 6) via PSU-level multiplier weights.
- **Note:** Both the iterative FE solver (`_iterative_fe`, Stage 1) and the iterative alternating-projection demeaning helper (`_iterative_demean`, used in covariate residualization) emit `UserWarning` when `max_iter` exhausts without reaching `tol`, via `diff_diff.utils.warn_if_not_converged`. Silent return of the current iterate was classified as a silent failure under the Phase 2 audit and replaced with an explicit signal to match the logistic/Poisson IRLS pattern in `linalg.py`.
- **Note:** When the Stage-2 bread `X'_2 W X_2` is singular, both the analytical TSL variance (`two_stage.py`) and the multiplier-bootstrap bread (`two_stage_bootstrap.py`) now emit a `UserWarning` before falling back to `np.linalg.lstsq`. Previously this fallback was silent. Sibling of axis-A finding #17 in the Phase 2 silent-failures audit; surfaced by the repo-wide lstsq-fallback pattern grep that accompanied the StaggeredTripleDifference fix.
- **Note:** The GMM sandwich and bootstrap paths both use `scipy.sparse.linalg.factorized` for the Stage 1 normal-equations solve `(X'_{10} W X_{10}) gamma = X'_1 W X_2` and fall back to dense `lstsq` when the sparse factorization raises `RuntimeError` on a near-singular matrix. Both fallback sites emit a `UserWarning` (silent-failure audit axis C) so callers know SE estimates came from the degraded path rather than the fast sparse path.

**Reference implementation(s):**
- R: `did2s::did2s()` (Kyle Butts & John Gardner)

**Requirements checklist:**
- [x] Stage 1: OLS on untreated observations only for unit+time FE
- [x] Stage 2: Regress residualized outcomes on treatment indicators
- [x] Point estimates match ImputationDiD
- [x] GMM sandwich variance (Newey & McFadden 1994 Theorem 6.1)

**Key implementation requirements:**

*Assumption checks / warnings:*
- Assumption 1 (No Anticipation): ATT(a, a+e) = 0 for all e < 0
- Assumption 2 (Common Trends): E[Y_{s,a+e}(0) - Y_{s,a-1}(0) | A_s = a] = E[Y_{s,a+e}(0) - Y_{s,a-1}(0) | A_s > a + e]

    Y_sae = alpha_0 + alpha_1 * D_sa + sum_{h != -1} [lambda_h * 1(e=h) + delta_h * D_sa * 1(e=h)] + U_sae

Estimated via WLS with Q-weights. The delta_h coefficients identify theta_kappa^e.

*Q-weights (Section 5.3, Table 1):*

    Q_sa = 1                                           if D_sa = 1 (treated)
    Q_sa = (N_a^D / N^D) / (N_a^C / N^C)             if D_sa = 0 (control, aggregate weighting)
    Q_sa = (Pop_a^D / Pop^D) / (N_a^C / N^C)         if D_sa = 0 (control, population weighting)
    Q_sa = ((N_a + N_a^C)/(N^D+N^C)) / (N_a^C/N^C)  if D_sa = 0 (control, sample share weighting)

*Standard errors (Section 5.4):*
- Default: Cluster-robust standard errors at the group (unit) level
- Alternative: Cluster at group x sub-experiment level
- Both approaches yield approximately correct coverage when clusters > 100 (Table 2)
- No special bootstrap procedure specified; standard cluster-robust SEs recommended
- For post-period average: delta method or `lincom`/`marginaleffects`

*Edge cases:*
- All events trimmed: `len(Omega_kappa) == 0` -> ValueError suggesting reduced kappa
- No clean controls for event a: IC2 check fails -> Trim event, warn user
- Single cohort in trimmed set: Valid — Q-weights simplify
- Duplicate observations: Same (unit, time) appears in multiple sub-experiments -> handled by clustering at unit level
- Constant treatment share across sub-exps: Unweighted FE recovers correct estimand (special case, Section 5.5)
- Anticipation > 0: Reference period shifts to e = -1 - anticipation. Post-treatment includes anticipation periods (e >= -anticipation). Window expands by anticipation pre-periods.
- Group aggregation: Not supported — pooled stacked regression cannot produce cohort-specific effects. Use CallawaySantAnna or ImputationDiD.

*Algorithm (Section 5):*
1. Choose kappa_pre, kappa_post event window
2. Apply IC1 (window fits in data) and IC2 (clean controls exist) to get Omega_kappa
3. For each a in Omega_kappa: build sub-experiment with treated (A_s = a), clean controls (A_s > a + kappa_post), time window [a - kappa_pre, a + kappa_post] (with anticipation: [a - kappa_pre - anticipation, a + kappa_post])
4. Stack all sub-experiments vertically
5. Compute Q-weights: aggregate weighting uses observation counts per (event_time, sub_exp), matching R reference. Population/sample_share use unit counts per sub_exp (paper notation).
6. Run WLS regression of Equation 3 with Q-weights
7. Extract delta_h coefficients as event-study ATTs
8. Compute cluster-robust SEs at unit level

*IC1 (Adoption Event Window, Section 3):*

    IC1_a = 1[a - kappa_pre >= T_min  AND  a + kappa_post <= T_max]

Note: Matches R reference implementation (`focalAdoptionTime - kappa_pre >= minTime`).
The reference period a-1 is included in the window [a-kappa_pre, a+kappa_post] when kappa_pre >= 1.
The paper text states a stricter bound (T_min + 1) but the R code by the co-author uses T_min.

*IC2 (Clean Controls Exist, Section 3):*

    IC2_a = 1[exists s with A_s > a + kappa_post]    (not_yet_treated)
    IC2_a = 1[exists s with A_s > a + kappa_post + kappa_pre]  (strict)
    IC2_a = 1[exists s with A_s = infinity]           (never_treated)

**Reference implementation(s):**
- R: https://github.com/hollina/stacked-did-weights (`create_sub_exp()`, `compute_weights()`)
- No Stata or Python package; Stata estimation via standard `reghdfe` with Q-weight column

**Requirements checklist:**
- [x] Sub-experiment construction with treated + clean controls + time window
- [x] IC1 and IC2 trimming with warnings
- [x] Q-weight computation for all three weighting schemes (Table 1)
- [x] WLS via sqrt(w) transformation
- [x] Event study regression (Equation 3) with reference period e=-1
- [x] Cluster-robust SEs at unit or unit x sub-exp level
- [x] Overall ATT as average of post-treatment delta_h with delta-method SE
- [x] Anticipation parameter support
- [x] Never-treated encoding (0 and inf)
- [x] Survey design support (Phase 3): Q-weights compose multiplicatively with survey weights; TSL vcov on composed weights; survey design columns propagated through sub-experiments. Replicate weights supported via estimator-level refit with Q-weight composition (see Replicate Weight Variance section).
- **Note:** Survey weights compose multiplicatively with Q-weights for StackedDiD; only `weight_type="pweight"` (default) is supported — `fweight` and `aweight` are rejected because Q-weight composition changes weight semantics (non-integer for fweight, non-inverse-variance for aweight)

**Application reference:** Nagengast, A. J., Rios-Avila, F., & Yotov, Y. V. (2026). The European single market and intra-EU trade: an assessment with heterogeneity-robust difference-in-differences methods. *Economica*, 93(369), 298–331.

**Reference implementation:** Stata: `jwdid` package (Rios-Avila, 2021). R: `etwfe` package (McDermott, 2023).

**Key implementation requirements:**

*Core estimand:*

    ATT(g, t) = E[Y_it(g) - Y_it(0) | G_i = g, T = t]    for t >= g

where `g` is cohort (first treatment period), `t` is calendar time.

*OLS design matrix (Wooldridge 2025, Section 5):*

The saturated ETWFE regression includes:
1. Unit fixed effects (absorbed via within-transformation or as dummies)
2. Time fixed effects (absorbed or as dummies)
3. Cohort×time treatment interactions: `I(G_i = g) * I(T = t)` for each post-treatment (g, t) cell
4. Additional covariates X_it interacted with cohort×time indicators (optional)

The interaction coefficient `δ_{g,t}` identifies `ATT(g, t)` under parallel trends.
- **Note:** OLS path uses iterative alternating-projection within-transformation (uniform weights) for exact FE absorption on both balanced and unbalanced panels. One-pass demeaning (`y - ȳ_i - ȳ_t + ȳ`) is only exact for balanced panels.
- **Note:** The weighted within-transformation (`utils.within_transform` with `weights`) is invoked on every WooldridgeDiD fit (survey weights when provided, `np.ones` otherwise) and emits a `UserWarning` on non-convergence per the shared convention documented under *Absorbed Fixed Effects with Survey Weights*.
- **Note:** NaN values in the `cohort` column are filled with 0 (treated as never-treated), both in `_filter_sample` and in `fit()`. This recategorization now emits a `UserWarning` reporting the affected row count so it is no longer silent (axis-E silent coercion under the Phase 2 audit). Pass `0` directly for never-treated units to avoid the warning.

*Nonlinear extensions (Wooldridge 2023):*

For binary outcomes (logit) and count outcomes (Poisson), Wooldridge (2023) provides an
Average Structural Function (ASF) approach. For each treated cell (g, t):

    ATT(g, t) = mean_i[g(η_i + δ_{g,t}) - g(η_i)]   over units i in cell (g, t)

where `g(·)` is the link inverse (logistic or exp), `η_i` is the individual linear predictor
(fixed effects + controls), and `δ_{g,t}` is the interaction coefficient from the nonlinear model.

*Standard errors:*
- OLS: Cluster-robust sandwich estimator at the unit level (default)
- Logit/Poisson: QMLE sandwich `(X'WX)^{-1} meat (X'WX)^{-1}` via `compute_robust_vcov(..., weights=w, weight_type="aweight")` where `w = p_i(1-p_i)` for logit or `w = μ_i` for Poisson
- Delta-method SEs for ATT(g,t) from nonlinear models: `Var(ATT) = ∇θ' Σ_β ∇θ`
- Joint delta method for overall ATT: `agg_grad = Σ_k (w_k/w_total) * ∇θ_k`
- **Deviation from R:** R's `etwfe` package uses `fixest` for nonlinear paths; this implementation uses direct QMLE via `compute_robust_vcov` to avoid a statsmodels/fixest dependency.
- **Note:** QMLE sandwich uses `weight_type="aweight"` which applies `(G/(G-1)) * ((n-1)/(n-k))` small-sample adjustment. Stata `jwdid` uses `G/(G-1)` only. The `(n-1)/(n-k)` term is conservative (inflates SEs slightly). For typical ETWFE panels where n >> k, the difference is negligible.

*Aggregations (matching `jwdid_estat`):*
- `simple`: Weighted average across all post-treatment (g, t) cells with weights `n_{g,t}`:

      ATT_overall = Σ_{(g,t): t≥g} n_{g,t} · ATT(g,t) / Σ_{(g,t): t≥g} n_{g,t}

  Cell weight `n_{g,t}` = count of obs in cohort g at time t in estimation sample.
  - **Note:** Cell-level weighting (n_{g,t} observation counts) matches Stata `jwdid_estat` behavior. Differs from W2025 Eqs. 7.2-7.4 cohort-share weights that account for the number of post-treatment periods per cohort.

- `group`: Weighted average across t for each cohort g
- `calendar`: Weighted average across g for each calendar time t
- `event`: Weighted average across (g, t) cells by relative period k = t - g

*Covariates:*
- `exovar`: Time-invariant covariates, added without demeaning (corresponds to W2025 Eq. 5.2 `x_i`)
- `xtvar`: Time-varying covariates, demeaned within cohort×period cells when `demean_covariates=True` (corresponds to W2025 Eq. 10.2 `x_hat_itgs = x_it - x_bar_gs`)
- `xgvar`: Covariates interacted with each cohort indicator
- **Note:** Covariate-adjusted ETWFE includes the full W2025 Eq. 5.3 basis: raw X, cohort × X (D_g × X for treated cohorts, auto-generated for `exovar`/`xtvar`), time × X (f_t × X, drop first period), and cell × demeaned X (D_{g,t} × X̃). Variables in `xgvar` already contribute D_g × X via `_prepare_covariates`; `exovar`/`xtvar` get automatic D_g × X generation.
- **Note:** `xtvar` demeaning operates at the cohort×period level (W2025 Eq. 10.2), not the cohort level (W2025 Eq. 5.2). These are identical for time-constant covariates but differ for time-varying covariates.

*Control groups:*
- `not_yet_treated` (default): Control pool includes units not yet treated at time t (same as Callaway-Sant'Anna)
- `never_treated`: Control pool restricted to never-treated units only

*Edge cases:*
- Single cohort (no staggered adoption): Reduces to standard 2×2 DiD
- Missing cohorts: Only cohorts observed in the data are included in interactions
- Anticipation: When `anticipation > 0`, interactions include periods `t >= g - anticipation`
- **Note:** Aggregation (simple/group/calendar) uses `t >= g` as the post-treatment threshold regardless of `anticipation`. Anticipation-window cells (g - anticipation <= t < g) are estimated but treated as pre-treatment placebos in aggregation, not included in overall ATT. This matches the standard post-treatment ATT definition; users who want anticipation cells in the aggregate should compute custom weighted averages from `group_time_effects`.
- Never-treated control only: Pre-treatment periods still estimable as placebo ATTs
- **Note:** Poisson QMLE with cohort+time dummies (not unit dummies) is consistent even in short panels (Wooldridge 1999, JBES). The exponential mean function is unique in that incidental parameters from group dummies do not cause inconsistency.
- **Note:** Logit path uses cohort×time additive dummies (not unit dummies) to avoid incidental parameters bias — a standard limitation of logit FE in short panels. This matches Stata `jwdid method(logit)` which uses `i.gvar i.tvar`.
- **Note:** Nonlinear methods (logit, Poisson) with `control_group="never_treated"` restrict the interaction matrix to post-treatment cells only. Pre-treatment placebo cells are OLS-only (where within-transformation absorbs FE). Including all (g,t) cells in the nonlinear design creates exact collinearity between cohort dummies and cell indicator sums, leading to a data-dependent normalization via QR dropping.

*Algorithm:*
1. Identify cohorts G and time periods T from data
2. Build within-transformed design matrix (absorb unit + time FE)
3. Append cohort×time interaction columns for all post-treatment cells
4. Fit OLS/logit/Poisson
5. For nonlinear: compute ASF-based ATT(g,t) and delta-method SEs per cell
6. For OLS: extract δ_{g,t} coefficients directly as ATT(g,t)
7. Compute overall ATT as weighted average; store full vcov for aggregate SEs
8. Optionally run multiplier bootstrap for overall SE

**Requirements checklist:**
- [x] Saturated cohort×time interaction design matrix
- [x] Unit + time FE absorption (within-transformation)
- [x] OLS, logit (IRLS), and Poisson (IRLS) fitting methods
- [x] Cluster-robust SEs at unit level for all methods
- [x] ASF-based ATT for nonlinear methods with delta-method SEs
- [x] Joint delta-method SE for aggregate ATT in nonlinear models
- [x] Four aggregation types: simple, group, calendar, event
- [x] Both control groups: not_yet_treated, never_treated
- [x] Anticipation parameter support
- [x] Multiplier bootstrap (Rademacher/Webb/Mammen) for OLS overall SE
- [x] Survey design support (strata/PSU/FPC with TSL variance)

**Survey design notes:**
- **OLS path:** Survey-weighted within-transformation + WLS via `solve_ols(weights=...)` + TSL vcov via `compute_survey_vcov()`.
- **Logit/Poisson paths:** Survey-weighted IRLS via `solve_logit(weights=...)`/`solve_poisson(weights=...)` + X_tilde linearization trick for TSL vcov: `X_tilde = X * sqrt(V)`, `r_tilde = (y - mu) / sqrt(V)`, then `compute_survey_vcov(X_tilde, r_tilde, resolved)` gives correct QMLE sandwich. ASF means and gradients use survey-weighted averaging.
- **Note:** Only `pweight` (probability weights) are supported; `fweight`/`aweight` raise `ValueError` because the composed survey/QMLE weighting changes their semantics.
- **Note:** Replicate-weight variance is not yet supported (`NotImplementedError`). Use TSL (strata/PSU/FPC) instead.
- **Note:** Bootstrap inference (`n_bootstrap > 0`) cannot be combined with `survey_design` — no survey-aware bootstrap variant is implemented.

# Advanced Estimators

## SyntheticDiD

**Primary source:** [Arkhangelsky, D., Athey, S., Hirshberg, D.A., Imbens, G.W., & Wager, S. (2021). Synthetic Difference-in-Differences. *American Economic Review*, 111(12), 4088-4118.](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20190159)

**Key implementation requirements:**

*Assumption checks / warnings:*
- Requires balanced panel (same units observed in all periods)
- Warns if pre-treatment fit is poor (high RMSE)
- Treatment must be "block" structure: all treated units treated at same time

*Estimator equation (as implemented):*

```
τ̂^sdid = Σ_t λ_t (Ȳ_{tr,t} - Σ_j ω_j Y_{j,t})
```

where Ȳ_{tr,t} is the mean treated outcome at time t, ω_j are unit weights, and λ_t are time weights.

*Unit weights ω (Frank-Wolfe on collapsed form):*

Build collapsed-form matrix Y_unit of shape (T_pre, N_co + 1), where the last column is the mean treated pre-period outcomes. Solve via Frank-Wolfe on the simplex:

```
min_{ω on simplex}  ζ_ω² ||ω||₂² + (1/T_pre) ||A_centered ω - b_centered||₂²
```

where A = Y_unit[:, :N_co], b = Y_unit[:, N_co], and centering is column-wise (intercept=True).

**Two-pass sparsification procedure** (matches R's `synthdid::sc.weight.fw` + `sparsify_function`):
1. First pass: Run Frank-Wolfe for 100 iterations (max_iter_pre_sparsify) from uniform initialization
2. Sparsify: `v[v <= max(v)/4] = 0; v = v / sum(v)` (zero out small weights, renormalize)
3. Second pass: Run Frank-Wolfe for 10000 iterations (max_iter) starting from sparsified weights

The sparsification step concentrates weights on the most important control units, improving interpretability and stability.

*Time weights λ (Frank-Wolfe on collapsed form):*

Build collapsed-form matrix Y_time of shape (N_co, T_pre + 1), where the last column is the per-control post-period mean (averaged across post-periods for each control unit). Solve:

```
min_{λ on simplex}  ζ_λ² ||λ||₂² + (1/N_co) ||A_centered λ - b_centered||₂²
```

where A = Y_time[:, :T_pre], b = Y_time[:, T_pre], and centering is column-wise.

*Auto-regularization (matching R's synthdid):*
```
noise_level = sd(first_differences of control outcomes)   # pooled across units
zeta_omega  = (N_treated × T_post)^(1/4) × noise_level
zeta_lambda = 1e-6 × noise_level
```

The noise level is computed as the standard deviation (ddof=1) of `np.diff(Y_pre_control, axis=0)`,
which computes first-differences across time for each control unit and pools all values.
This matches R's `sd(apply(Y[1:N0, 1:T0], 1, diff))`.

*Frank-Wolfe step (matches R's `fw.step()`):*
```
half_grad = A' (A x - b) + η x        # η = N × ζ²
i = argmin(half_grad)                   # vertex selection (simplex corner)
d_x = e_i - x                          # direction toward vertex i
step = -(half_grad · d_x) / (||A d_x||² + η ||d_x||²)
step = clip(step, 0, 1)
x_new = x + step × d_x
```

Convergence criterion: stop when objective decrease < min_decrease² (default min_decrease = 1e-5 × noise_level, max_iter = 10000, max_iter_pre_sparsify = 100).

*Standard errors:*

- Default: Placebo variance estimator (Algorithm 4 in paper)
  1. Randomly permute control unit indices
  2. Split into pseudo-controls (first N_co - N_tr) and pseudo-treated (last N_tr)
  3. Re-estimate unit weights (Frank-Wolfe) on pseudo-control/pseudo-treated data
  4. Re-estimate time weights (Frank-Wolfe) on pseudo-control data
  5. Compute SDID estimate with re-estimated weights
  6. Repeat `replications` times (default 200)
  7. `SE = sqrt((r-1)/r) × sd(placebo_estimates)` where r = number of successful replications

  This matches R's `synthdid::vcov(method="placebo")` which passes `update.omega=TRUE, update.lambda=TRUE` via `opts`.

- Alternative: Bootstrap at unit level — paper-faithful refit (`variance_method="bootstrap"`)
  Arkhangelsky et al. (2021) Algorithm 2 step 2 verbatim, and also the behavior of R's default `synthdid::vcov(method="bootstrap")`. On each pairs-bootstrap draw:
  1. Resample ALL units (control + treated) with replacement.
  2. Identify which resampled units are control vs treated.
  3. Re-estimate `ω̂_b = compute_sdid_unit_weights(Y_boot_pre_c, Y_boot_pre_t_mean, zeta_omega=ζ_ω / Y_scale, init_weights=_sum_normalize(ω̂[boot_control_idx]))` — two-pass sparsified Frank-Wolfe, **warm-started from the fit-time ω renormalized over the resampled controls** (matching R's `sum_normalize(weights$omega[sort(ind[ind <= N0])])` shape).
  4. Re-estimate `λ̂_b = compute_time_weights(Y_boot_pre_c, Y_boot_post_c, zeta_lambda=ζ_λ / Y_scale, init_weights=λ̂)` — **warm-started from the fit-time λ unchanged** (matching R's `weights.boot$lambda = weights$lambda` shape).
  5. Compute SDID estimate with refit `ω̂_b` and `λ̂_b`.
  6. `SE = sqrt((r-1)/r) × sd(bootstrap_estimates, ddof=1)` where `r = n_successful` (equivalent to the paper's `σ̂² = (1/r) Σ (τ_b − τ̄)²`).

  R-parity rationale: `synthdid_estimate()` (synthdid.R) stores `update.omega = TRUE` in `attr(estimate, "opts")`, and `vcov.R::bootstrap_sample` rebinds those `opts` inside its `do.call` back into `synthdid_estimate`, so the renormalized ω passed via `weights$omega` is used as Frank-Wolfe initialization (the `sum_normalize` helper in R's source explicitly says so). The Python path threads the same warm-start via `compute_sdid_unit_weights(..., init_weights=...)` and `compute_time_weights(..., init_weights=...)`. The FW objective is strictly convex on the simplex (quadratic loss + ζ² ridge on simplex), so warm- and cold-start converge to the same global minimum given enough iterations; warm-start matters in practice because the 100-iter first pass then sparsification is path-dependent on draws where the pre-sparsify budget is tight. Cross-language SE parity at bit tolerance is not claimed — different BLAS / RNG paths — but the procedure matches R's default bootstrap shape at the algorithm level, and Python-only bit-identity on non-survey data is asserted via `TestScaleEquivariance::test_baseline_parity_small_scale[bootstrap]` at `rel=1e-14`.

  Expected wall-clock ~5–30× slower per fit than placebo (panel-size dependent; Frank-Wolfe second-pass can hit its 10K-iter cap on larger panels; warm-start plumbing closes the gap vs cold-start, which would be closer to 10–30× on these DGPs). Per-draw Frank-Wolfe non-convergence UserWarnings are suppressed inside the loop and aggregated into a single summary warning emitted after the loop when the share of valid bootstrap draws with any non-convergence event (counted once per draw — each draw runs Frank-Wolfe once for ω and once for λ, and any of those calls firing a non-convergence warning trips the draw) exceeds 5% of `n_successful`. Composed with survey designs (pweight-only OR strata/PSU/FPC) this path uses the weighted Frank-Wolfe kernel and the per-draw dispatch described in the "Note (survey + bootstrap composition)" below.

- Alternative: Jackknife variance (matching R's `synthdid::vcov(method="jackknife")`)
  Implements Algorithm 3 from Arkhangelsky et al. (2021):
  1. For each control unit j=1,...,N_co:
     - Remove unit j, renormalize omega: `ω_jk = _sum_normalize(ω[remaining])`
     - Keep λ unchanged, keep treated means unchanged
     - Compute SDID estimate τ_{(-j)}
  2. For each treated unit k=1,...,N_tr:
     - Keep ω and λ unchanged
     - Recompute treated mean from remaining N_tr-1 treated units
     - Compute SDID estimate τ_{(-k)}
  3. `SE = sqrt( ((n-1)/n) × Σ (τ_{(-i)} - τ̄)² )` where n = N_co + N_tr

  Fixed weights: No Frank-Wolfe re-estimation (`update.omega=FALSE, update.lambda=FALSE`).
  Returns NaN SE for single treated unit or single nonzero-weight control.
  Deterministic: exactly N_co + N_tr iterations, no replications parameter.
  P-value: analytical (normal distribution), not empirical.

*Edge cases:*
- **Frank-Wolfe non-convergence**: Returns current weights after max_iter iterations when the convergence check `vals[t-1] - vals[t] < min_decrease²` never triggers early exit. On `variance_method="bootstrap"` specifically, `_bootstrap_se` uses the `sc_weight_fw_with_convergence` Rust entry point (or `_sc_weight_fw_numpy(return_convergence=True)` on the pure-Python backend) to thread a convergence bool out of every per-draw FW pass; draws with any non-convergence are tallied and, if the rate exceeds 5% of valid draws, aggregated into a single `UserWarning` after the loop (avoids 200+ warnings per fit). Standalone calls to `_sc_weight_fw` / `compute_sdid_unit_weights` / `compute_time_weights` that do not pass `return_convergence=True` follow the legacy behavior: the numpy path emits a per-call `UserWarning` via `diff_diff.utils.warn_if_not_converged` and the Rust path silently returns the final iterate.
- **`_sparsify` all-zero input**: If `max(v) <= 0`, returns uniform weights `ones(len(v)) / len(v)`.
- **Single control unit**: `compute_sdid_unit_weights` returns `[1.0]` immediately (short-circuit before Frank-Wolfe).
- **Zero control units**: `compute_sdid_unit_weights` returns empty array `[]`.
- **Single pre-period**: `compute_time_weights` returns `[1.0]` when `n_pre <= 1` (Frank-Wolfe on a 1-element simplex is trivial).
- **Bootstrap with 0 control or 0 treated in resample (or non-finite `τ_b`)**: retry the draw. Matches R's `synthdid::bootstrap_sample` (`while (count < replications) { ...; if (!is.na(est)) count = count + 1 }`) and paper Algorithm 2 (B bootstrap replicates). A bounded attempt guard of `20 × n_bootstrap` prevents pathological-input hangs; normal fits finish far inside this budget because degenerate-draw probability scales as `(N_co / N)^N + (N_tr / N)^N`, which is small for any non-trivial split. If the budget is exhausted with 0 successful draws, raises `ValueError`. With 1 successful draw, warns and returns `SE = 0.0`. With fewer than `n_bootstrap` valid draws, warns that the attempt budget was exhausted and SE may be unreliable.
- **Placebo with n_control <= n_treated**: Warns that not enough control units for placebo variance estimation, returns SE=0.0 and empty placebo effects array. The check is `n_control - n_treated < 1`.
- **Note:** Power analysis functions (`simulate_power`, `simulate_mde`, `simulate_sample_size`) raise `ValueError` for placebo variance when `n_control <= n_treated`. The registry path checks pre-generation using `n_units * treatment_fraction`; the custom-DGP path checks post-generation on the realized data (first iteration only, since treatment allocation is deterministic per `n_units`/`treatment_fraction`).
- **Negative weights attempted**: Frank-Wolfe operates on the simplex (non-negative, sum-to-1), so weights are always feasible by construction. The step size is clipped to [0, 1] and the move is toward a simplex vertex.
- **Perfect pre-treatment fit**: Regularization (ζ² ||ω||²) prevents overfitting by penalizing weight concentration.
- **Single treated unit**: Valid; placebo variance uses jackknife-style permutations of controls.
- **Noise level with < 2 pre-periods**: Returns 0.0, which makes both zeta_omega and zeta_lambda equal to 0.0 (no regularization). **Note (deviation from R):** `min_decrease` uses a `1e-5` floor when `noise_level == 0` to enable Frank-Wolfe early stopping. R would use `0.0`, causing FW to run all `max_iter` iterations; the result is equivalent since zero-noise data has no variation to optimize.
- **NaN inference for undefined statistics**: t_stat uses NaN when SE is zero or non-finite; p_value and CI also NaN. Matches CallawaySantAnna NaN convention.
- **Placebo p-value floor**: `p_value = max(empirical_p, 1/(n_replications + 1))` to avoid reporting exactly zero.
- **Varying treatment within unit**: Raises `ValueError`. SDID requires block treatment (constant within each unit). Suggests CallawaySantAnna or ImputationDiD for staggered adoption.
- **Unbalanced panel**: Raises `ValueError`. SDID requires all units observed in all periods. Suggests `balance_panel()`.
- **Poor pre-treatment fit**: Warns (`UserWarning`) when `pre_fit_rmse > std(treated_pre_outcomes, ddof=1)`. Diagnostic only; estimation proceeds.
- **Jackknife with single treated unit**: Returns NaN SE. Cannot leave-one-out with N_tr=1; R returns NA for the same condition.
- **Jackknife with single nonzero-weight control**: Returns NaN SE. Leaving out the only effective control is not meaningful.
- **Jackknife with non-finite LOO estimate**: Returns NaN SE. Unlike bootstrap/placebo, jackknife is deterministic and cannot skip failed iterations; NaN propagates through `var()` (matches R behavior).
- **Jackknife with survey weights**: Guards on effective positive support (omega * w_control > 0 and w_treated > 0) after composition, not raw FW counts. Returns NaN SE if fewer than 2 effective controls or 2 positive-weight treated units. Per-iteration zero-sum guards return NaN for individual LOO iterations when remaining composed weights sum to zero.

  | variance_method | pweight-only | strata/PSU/FPC |
  |-----------------|:------------:|:--------------:|
  | `bootstrap`     | ✓ weighted FW | ✓ weighted FW + Rao-Wu rescaling (PR #355) |
  | `placebo`       | ✓             | ✓ stratified permutation + weighted FW |
  | `jackknife`     | ✓             | ✓ PSU-level LOO with stratum aggregation |

  **Pweight-only path** (placebo / jackknife / bootstrap): treated-side means are survey-weighted (Frank-Wolfe target and ATT formula); control-side synthetic weights are composed with survey weights post-optimization (ω_eff = ω * w_co, renormalized). Fit-time Frank-Wolfe is unweighted — survey importance enters after trajectory-matching. Covariate residualization uses WLS with survey weights.

  **Bootstrap survey path** (PR #355): for pweight-only the per-draw FW uses constant `rw = w_control`; for full design (strata/PSU/FPC) the per-draw `rw = generate_rao_wu_weights(resolved_survey, rng)` rescaling is composed with the same weighted-FW kernel. See "Note (survey + bootstrap composition)" below for the full objective and the argmin-set caveat.

  **Placebo survey path**: for pweight-only the existing Algorithm 4 flow applies with survey-weighted pseudo-treated means + post-hoc ω_eff composition. For designs with explicit `strata` and/or `psu` the allocator switches to **stratified permutation** (Pesarin 2001): pseudo-treated indices are drawn within each stratum containing actual treated units; weighted-FW re-estimates ω and λ per draw with per-control survey weights threaded into both loss and regularization. See "Note (survey + placebo composition)" below. **FPC is a documented no-op for placebo** — permutation tests are conditional on the observed sample (Pesarin 2001 §1.5), so the sampling fraction does not enter Algorithm 4 or its survey extension; an `fpc=` column on a placebo fit emits a `UserWarning` and is preserved in the design metadata but never enters the variance computation. Routing is gated on `strata` / `psu` only — FPC alone does not flip dispatch from the non-survey to the survey placebo path.

  **Jackknife survey path**: for pweight-only the existing Algorithm 3 flow applies (unit-level LOO with subset + rw-composed-renormalized ω; λ fixed). For full design the allocator switches to **PSU-level LOO with stratum aggregation** (Rust & Rao 1996): leave out one PSU at a time within each stratum, aggregate as `SE² = Σ_h (1-f_h)·(n_h-1)/n_h·Σ_{j∈h}(τ̂_{(h,j)} - τ̄_h)²`. See "Note (survey + jackknife composition)" below.

  **Allocator asymmetry** (placebo ignores PSU axis; jackknife respects it): intentional. Placebo is a null-distribution test — within-stratum unit-level permutation is the classical stratified permutation test (Pesarin 2001 Ch. 3-4); PSU-level permutation on few PSUs (2-8 typical for survey designs) produces near-degenerate permutation support and poor power. Jackknife is a design-based variance approximation — PSU-level LOO within strata is the canonical survey jackknife (Rust & Rao 1996); unit-level LOO under clustering would underestimate SE. Both allocators respect strata (the primary survey-design axis). Neither is "right" in all dimensions; each is the defensible analog for its hypothesis-testing vs variance-approximation role.
- **Note (default variance_method deviation from R):** R's `synthdid::vcov()` defaults to `method="bootstrap"`; our `SyntheticDiD.__init__` defaults to `variance_method="placebo"`. Library deviation rationale: placebo avoids the ~5–30× per-draw Frank-Wolfe refit slowdown. All three variance methods (placebo, bootstrap, jackknife) now support both pweight-only and full strata/PSU/FPC survey designs (see the survey support matrix above); users can opt into R's default with `variance_method="bootstrap"`, which is also the recommended choice on surveys with few PSUs per stratum (jackknife is anti-conservative in that regime per the "Note (survey + jackknife composition)" above). Placebo (Algorithm 4) and bootstrap (Algorithm 2 step 2) both track nominal calibration in the committed coverage MC; see the calibration table below.
- **Note (survey + bootstrap composition — PR #355):** Restored capability. The bootstrap survey path solves the **weighted Frank-Wolfe** variant of `_sc_weight_fw` accepting per-unit weights in loss and regularization. For unit weights:
  ```
  min_{ω simplex}  Σ_t (Σ_i rw_i · ω_i · Y_i,pre[t] - treated_pre[t])²  +  ζ²·Σ_i rw_i · ω_i²
  ```
  Implementation: column-scales A by `rw_control` (so the loss term reads `||A·diag(rw)·ω - b||²`) and passes `reg_weights=rw_control` to the weighted Rust kernel for the diag(rw) penalty. The FW returns ω on the standard simplex; `_bootstrap_se` composes `ω_eff = rw·ω / Σ(rw·ω)` for the downstream `compute_sdid_estimator` call (which expects a normalized weight vector). For time weights, the loss becomes per-row weighted (`||diag(√rw)·(A·λ - b)||²`) and regularization on λ stays uniform — λ is per-period, rw is per-control, no alignment for per-λ reg weighting.

  **Argmin-set caveat (deliberate):** this objective is NOT the same as directly minimizing the standard SDID loss on `ω_eff` (the scaling factor `(Σ rw·ω)²` enters the loss-on-θ reparameterization non-constantly). The chosen form mirrors the spirit of the pre-PR-#351 Rao-Wu fixed-weight composition (rescale + renormalize) but with ω re-estimated per draw under the weighted objective, so weight-estimation uncertainty propagates correctly. No external R/Julia parity anchor exists because neither package defines survey-weighted SDID FW; validation rests on the coverage MC calibration row below (`stratified_survey × bootstrap`, target rejection ∈ [0.02, 0.10] at α=0.05).

  **Per-draw dispatch:**
  - pweight-only → `rw = w_control[boot_idx_control]` (constant per draw, no Rao-Wu).
  - full design → `rw = generate_rao_wu_weights(resolved_survey_unit, rng)` per draw, sliced over the resampled units. Rao-Wu rescales weights by `(n_h/m_h)·r_hi` within each stratum; degenerate-retry on zero-mass control or treated draws.
  - **single-PSU short-circuit**: unstratified single-PSU designs return NaN SE (resampling one PSU yields the same subset every draw — bootstrap distribution is unidentified).
- **Note (survey + placebo composition):** Stratified-permutation allocator composed with the same weighted Frank-Wolfe kernel from the bootstrap survey path. Each placebo draw:
  1. For each stratum `h` containing actual treated units, draws `n_treated_h` pseudo-treated indices uniformly without replacement from `controls_in_h`. Non-treated strata contribute their controls unconditionally to the pseudo-control set.
  2. Pseudo-treated means are survey-weighted: `Y_pseudo_t = np.average(Y[:, pseudo_treated_idx], weights=w_control[pseudo_treated_idx])`.
  3. Weighted Frank-Wolfe re-estimates ω and λ on the pseudo-panel using `compute_sdid_unit_weights_survey(rw_control=w_control[pseudo_control_idx], ...)` and `compute_time_weights_survey(...)`. Post-optimization composition `ω_eff = rw·ω/Σ(rw·ω)` with zero-mass retry.
  4. SDID estimator on the pseudo-panel; Algorithm 4 SE `sqrt((r-1)/r)·std(placebo_estimates, ddof=1)`.

  **Fit-time feasibility guards** (per `feedback_front_door_over_retry_swallow.md`): four distinct failure cases are rejected *before* entering the retry loop, each with a targeted `ValueError`:
  * **Case B** (`n_controls_h == 0` for some treated-containing stratum): the stratum has treated units but no controls — no pseudo-treated set can be drawn.
  * **Case C** (`0 < n_controls_h < n_treated_h`): the stratum has fewer controls than treated units, so exact-count without-replacement sampling is impossible.
  * **Case E** (row-count guards passed but `n_positive_weight_controls_h < n_treated_h`): the stratum has enough raw controls but too few have positive survey weight. Since the pseudo-treated mean uses `np.average(Y, weights=w_control[idx])`, draws can pick all-zero-weight subsets (ZeroDivisionError on np.average) and the retry loop would swallow them as a generic ``n_successful=0`` warning + ``SE=0.0``.
  * **Case D** (effective single-support — *every* treated stratum collapses to one positive-mass mean): two shapes trigger this. **(D-classical)** `n_controls_h == n_treated_h` so the without-replacement permutation has only one subset. **(D-effective)** `n_c_h > n_t_h` (raw count allows multiple subsets) but `n_positive_weight_controls_h < 2` — every successful pseudo-treated mean reduces to the unique positive-weight control's outcome (zero-weight cohabitants contribute 0 to numerator and denominator). Both shapes give a degenerate null (SE = FP noise ~1e-16). Non-degeneracy requires **both** `n_c_h > n_t_h` AND `n_positive_weight_controls_h >= 2` for at least one treated stratum.

  Partial-permutation fallback is rejected for all four cases — it would silently change the null distribution and produce an incoherent test.

  **Scope note — what is NOT randomized:** the stratum marginal is preserved exactly by construction (each draw pulls the same count per treated stratum). The PSU axis is not randomized (permutation is unit-level within strata). This is conservative under clustering (ignores within-stratum PSU correlation in the null) but aligns with the classical stratified permutation test literature. See Pesarin (2001) *Multivariate Permutation Tests*, Ch. 3-4; Pesarin & Salmaso (2010) *Permutation Tests for Complex Data*.

  **Validation:** no external R/Julia parity anchor (neither package defines survey-weighted SDID placebo). Correctness rests on: (a) stratum-membership contract enforced by construction + per-draw `rng.choice` interception regression that captures every actual sampled `pseudo_treated_idx` and asserts each sampled control's stratum membership ⊆ treated-strata set, (b) Case B / C / D / E front-door guards with targeted-message regression tests, (c) SE-differs-from-pweight-only cross-surface sanity, (d) deterministic-dispatch regression.

- **Note (survey + jackknife composition):** PSU-level leave-one-out with stratum aggregation (Rust & Rao 1996). For a design with strata `h = 1..H` and PSUs `j = 1..n_h` within each stratum:

  ```
  SE² = Σ_h (1 - f_h) · (n_h - 1)/n_h · Σ_{j∈h} (τ̂_{(h,j)} - τ̄_h)²
  ```

  where `τ̂_{(h,j)}` is the SDID estimator computed after leaving out all units in PSU `j` of stratum `h`; `τ̄_h` is the stratum-level mean of successful LOO estimates; `f_h = n_h_sampled / fpc[h]` is the per-stratum sampling fraction. FPC is stored as a per-unit **population-count** array by `SurveyDesign.resolve` (see `survey.py:338-356`, where `fpc_h < n_psu_h` is the validation constraint), so `f_h` is recovered by `f_h = n_h / fpc[strata == h][0]`. No FPC → `f_h = 0`.

  **Fixed weights per LOO:** matches Algorithm 3 of Arkhangelsky et al. (2021). ω is subsetted over kept controls, composed with kept `w_control`, renormalized (`ω_eff_kept = rw·ω / Σ(rw·ω)`); λ is held at the fit-time value. Rationale: jackknife is a design-based variance approximation, not a refit-variance bootstrap. Re-estimating λ or ω per LOO would conflate weight-estimation uncertainty (bootstrap's domain) with sampling uncertainty (jackknife's domain).

  **Undefined-replicate handling** (return NaN, do NOT silently skip): the Rust & Rao formula requires `τ̂_{(h,j)}` be defined for every PSU `j` in every contributing stratum. If any single LOO in a contributing stratum (`n_h ≥ 2`) is not computable — (a) deletion removes all treated units (e.g., all treated in one PSU), (b) `ω_eff_kept.sum() ≤ 0` after composition, (c) `w_treated_kept.sum() ≤ 0`, (d) the SDID estimator raises or returns non-finite τ̂ — the overall SE is **undefined** and the method returns `SE=NaN` with a targeted `UserWarning` naming the stratum / PSU / reason. Silently skipping the missing LOO while still applying the `(n_h-1)/n_h` factor would systematically under-scale variance (silently wrong SE). Users needing a variance estimator that accommodates PSU-deletion infeasibility should use `variance_method="bootstrap"`, whose pairs-bootstrap has no per-LOO feasibility constraint.

  **Zero-variance vs undefined distinction:** when every stratum contributes but `total_variance == 0.0` by legitimate design — full-census FPC (`f_h = 1` → `(1 - f_h) = 0` zeros the contribution even when within-stratum dispersion is non-zero) or exact-zero within-stratum dispersion — the jackknife SE is **zero**, not undefined. `_jackknife_se_survey` returns `SE = 0.0` in that case. `SE = NaN` is reserved for the truly-undefined cases documented above (all strata skipped; any undefined delete-one replicate).

  **`lonely_psu` contract:** `SurveyDesign(lonely_psu="remove")` (default) and `"certainty"` are both accepted, but with **different semantics** when *every* stratum is singleton:
  * `"remove"` silently skips singleton strata (matches R `survey::svyjkn` — they're dropped from the variance computation). If every stratum is skipped, returns ``SE = NaN`` with the "every stratum was skipped" warning (no contributing stratum, undefined).
  * `"certainty"` treats singleton strata as **explicit zero-variance contributors** (sampled with certainty, no sampling variance). Singleton strata still contribute 0 to total variance, but the stratum counts as "contributing" to the overall design — so an all-singleton design returns ``SE = 0.0`` (legitimate zero variance), not NaN. Mirrors `compute_survey_vcov`'s ``test_all_certainty_psu_zero_vcov`` contract for other estimators.

  `lonely_psu="adjust"` (R's overall-mean fallback) is **not yet supported** on the SDID jackknife path and raises `NotImplementedError` at fit-time; users needing that semantic should pick `variance_method="bootstrap"` (which supports all three modes via the weighted-FW + Rao-Wu path) or switch the design to `"remove"` / `"certainty"`.

  **Stratum-skip handling** (silent, documented): strata with `n_h < 2` are silently skipped (stratum-level variance unidentified — the `lonely-PSU` case in R `survey::svyjkn`). If every stratum is skipped, returns `SE=NaN` with a separate `UserWarning`. PSU-None designs: each unit is treated as its own PSU within its stratum (matches the implicit-PSU convention established in PR #355 R8 P1). Unstratified single-PSU short-circuits to `SE=NaN`.

  **Scope note — what is NOT randomized:** stratum membership and PSU composition are fixed by design. The formula only captures within-stratum variation; between-stratum variance is absorbed into the analytical-TSL / design assumption. This is canonical survey-jackknife behavior (Rust & Rao 1996) and matches R's `survey::svyjkn` under stratified designs.

  **Known limitation — anti-conservatism with few PSUs per stratum:** with `n_h = 2` per stratum (the minimum for variance identifiability), within-stratum jackknife has only 1 effective DoF per stratum — a well-documented limitation of the stratified jackknife formula. On the coverage MC `stratified_survey` DGP (2 PSUs × 2 strata), `se_over_truesd ≈ 0.46` at α=0.05. **Users needing tight SE calibration with few PSUs should prefer `variance_method="bootstrap"`**, which validates at near-nominal calibration on the same DGP.

  **Validation:** (a) hand-computed 2-stratum FPC magnitude regression (`test_jackknife_full_design_fpc_reduces_se_magnitude` — asserts `SE_fpc == SE_nofpc · sqrt(1 - f)` at `rtol=1e-10`), (b) self-consistency between the returned SE and the stratum-aggregation formula applied to the returned LOO estimates, (c) single-PSU-stratum skip, (d) all-strata-skipped UserWarning + NaN, (e) unstratified single-PSU short-circuit, (f) deterministic-dispatch regression.

- **Note:** P-value computation is variance-method dependent. Placebo (Algorithm 4) uses the empirical null formula `max(mean(|placebo_effects| ≥ |att|), 1/(r+1))` because permuting control indices generates draws from the null distribution (centered on 0). Bootstrap (Algorithm 2) and jackknife (Algorithm 3) use the analytical p-value from `safe_inference(att, se)` (normal-theory): bootstrap draws are centered on `τ̂` (sampling distribution of the estimator) and jackknife pseudo-values are not null draws, so the empirical null formula is invalid for them. This matches R's `synthdid::vcov()` convention, where variance is returned and inference is normal-theory from the SE.
- **Note (coverage Monte Carlo calibration):** `benchmarks/data/sdid_coverage.json` carries empirical rejection rates across the three variance methods on 4 representative null-panel DGPs (500 seeds × B=200, regenerable via `benchmarks/python/coverage_sdid.py`). The fourth DGP (`stratified_survey`, added in PR #355) validates the survey-bootstrap calibration; jackknife is also reported with a documented anti-conservatism caveat; placebo is N/A on this DGP because its cohort packs into a single stratum with 0 never-treated units (stratified-permutation allocator is structurally infeasible — see `test_placebo_full_design_raises_on_zero_control_stratum` / `_undersupplied_stratum` for the enforced behavior). Under H0 the nominal rejection rate at each α equals α; rates substantially above α indicate anti-conservatism, rates below indicate over-coverage.

    Reading: **`bootstrap` (paper-faithful refit)** and **`placebo`** both track nominal calibration across all three non-survey DGPs (rates within Monte Carlo noise at 500 seeds; 2σ MC band ≈ 0.02–0.05 at p ≈ 0.05–0.10). **`jackknife`** is slightly anti-conservative on the smaller panels (balanced, AER §6.3) at α=0.05 (rejection 0.112 and 0.080 vs the 0.05 target). Arkhangelsky et al. (2021) §6.3 reports mixed jackknife evidence (98% coverage — slightly conservative — under iid, and 93% coverage — slightly anti-conservative — under AR(1) ρ=0.7), so the direction of our observation is consistent with the AR(1) branch of the paper's evidence rather than the iid branch. The `mean SE / true SD` column compares mean estimated SE to the empirical sampling SD of τ̂ across seeds.

    **`stratified_survey × bootstrap` (PR #355)**: validates the weighted-FW + Rao-Wu composition added in that PR. Rejection at α=0.05 is 0.058 (inside the calibration gate [0.02, 0.10] widened from a 2σ band to accommodate the high ICC ≈ 0.84 induced by `psu_re_sd=1.5` with only 4 PSUs total). `mean SE / true SD = 1.13` indicates the bootstrap is slightly conservative (overestimates the empirical sampling SD by ~13%) — the safer direction; expected under Rao-Wu rescaling with few PSUs because the per-draw weights inflate variance from the resampling structure on top of the fit-time uncertainty.

    **`stratified_survey × jackknife`**: reported with an anti-conservative caveat. Rejection at α=0.05 is 0.450 (far outside any reasonable calibration gate) and `se_over_truesd ≈ 0.46`. This is the documented limitation of the stratified PSU-level jackknife formula with `n_h = 2` PSUs per stratum: within-stratum variance has only 1 effective DoF per stratum, and between-stratum variation is absorbed into the design assumption rather than the SE. The bootstrap row on the same DGP demonstrates that the fix is to pick `variance_method="bootstrap"` when the design has few PSUs per stratum. This row is committed for transparency; the methodology Note above (§"Note (survey + jackknife composition)") explicitly flags this regime and recommends bootstrap.

    **`stratified_survey × placebo`**: N/A on this DGP by construction (its cohort packs all treated units into stratum 1, which has 0 never-treated units, so the stratified-permutation allocator raises **Case B** — treated-containing stratum with zero controls — at fit-time; see Case B / C definitions in "Note (survey + placebo composition)" above). The placebo survey path is exercised under feasible structures in `tests/test_survey_phase5.py::TestSDIDSurveyPlaceboFullDesign`; calibration on a placebo-feasible DGP is a future MC extension.

    The schema smoke test is `TestCoverageMCArtifact::test_coverage_artifacts_present`; regenerate the JSON via `python benchmarks/python/coverage_sdid.py --n-seeds 500 --n-bootstrap 200 --output benchmarks/data/sdid_coverage.json` (~15–40 min on M-series Mac, Rust backend — warm-start convergence makes newer runs faster than the original cold-start one).

    **Artifact cadence (documentation-grade, not pinned-regression-grade):** this file is a documentation substrate — the table above transcribes from it, and the schema test just checks structure. It is **not** numerically pinned by any regression test, because MC noise at 500 seeds × B=200 (2σ ≈ 0.02–0.05 per cell) makes tight bounds fragile and loose bounds uninformative. The runtime characterization test that guards the one regression class worth catching (dispatch breakage → rejection rate ≈0 or ≈0.5, or SE-collapse) is `TestPValueSemantics::test_bootstrap_p_value_null_dispersion` (slow; calibration-agnostic dispersion + loose rejection-rate band). Regenerate the JSON when a methodology change materially shifts per-draw numerics — SE formula, new variance method, FW solver swap, paper-procedure correction. **Do not** regenerate on refactors that preserve the FW global optimum (warm-start vs cold-start, backend migration, pure renames, docstring fixes) — those stay within MC noise of the committed numbers. Per-seed bit-identity on the captured fixture is the cheaper, stricter check: see `TestScaleEquivariance::test_baseline_parity_small_scale[bootstrap]` at `rel=1e-14`.
- **Note:** Internal Y normalization. Before weight optimization, the estimator, and variance procedures, `fit()` centers Y by `mean(Y_pre_control)` and scales by `std(Y_pre_control)`; `Y_scale` falls back to `1.0` when std is non-finite or below `1e-12 * max(|mean|, 1)`. Auto-regularization and `noise_level` are computed on normalized Y; user-supplied `zeta_omega` / `zeta_lambda` are divided by `Y_scale` internally for Frank-Wolfe. τ, SE, CI, the placebo/bootstrap/jackknife effect vectors, `results_.noise_level`, and `results_.zeta_omega` / `results_.zeta_lambda` are all reported on the user's original outcome scale (user-supplied zetas are echoed back exactly to avoid float roundoff). Mathematically a no-op — τ is location-invariant and scale-equivariant, and FW weights are invariant under `(Y, ζ) → (Y/s, ζ/s)` — but prevents catastrophic cancellation in the SDID double-difference when outcomes span millions-to-billions (see synth-inference/synthdid#71 for the R-package version of this issue). Normalization constants are derived from controls' pre-period only so the reference is unaffected by treatment. `in_time_placebo()` and `sensitivity_to_zeta_omega()` reuse the exact same `Y_shift` / `Y_scale` captured on the fit snapshot: they normalize the re-sliced arrays before re-running Frank-Wolfe, pass `zeta / Y_scale` to the weight solvers, and rescale the returned `att` and `pre_fit_rmse` by `Y_scale` before reporting; unit-weight diagnostics (`max_unit_weight`, `effective_n`) are scale-invariant and reported directly.

*Validation diagnostics (post-fit methods on `SyntheticDiDResults`):*

- **Trajectories** (`synthetic_pre_trajectory`, `synthetic_post_trajectory`, `treated_pre_trajectory`, `treated_post_trajectory`): retained on results to support plotting and custom fit metrics. `synthetic_pre_trajectory = Y_pre_control @ ω_eff`; `treated_pre_trajectory` is the survey-weighted treated mean (matches the Frank-Wolfe target). `pre_treatment_fit` is recoverable as `RMSE(treated_pre_trajectory, synthetic_pre_trajectory)`.
- **`get_loo_effects_df()`**: user-facing join of the jackknife leave-one-out pseudo-values (stored in `placebo_effects`) to the underlying unit identities. **Unit-level LOO only** — available on the non-survey and pweight-only jackknife paths (classical Algorithm 3: one LOO per unit, first `n_control` positions map to `control_unit_ids`, next `n_treated` to `treated_unit_ids`; `att_loo` is NaN when the zero-sum composed-weight guard fired for that unit; `delta_from_full = att_loo - att`). Under the full-design survey jackknife path (PSU-level LOO with stratum aggregation, Rust & Rao 1996), the underlying replicates are PSU-level rather than unit-level — the accessor raises `NotImplementedError` pointing to `result.placebo_effects` for the raw PSU-level replicate array. Dispatch is gated by an explicit `_loo_granularity` flag set at fit-time (`"unit"` vs `"psu"`). Requires `variance_method='jackknife'`; raises `ValueError` otherwise.
- **`get_weight_concentration(top_k=5)`**: returns `effective_n = 1/Σω²` (inverse Herfindahl), `herfindahl`, `top_k_share`, `top_k`. Operates on `self.unit_weights` which stores the composed `ω_eff`; for survey-weighted fits the metrics reflect the population-weighted concentration, not the raw Frank-Wolfe solution.
- **`in_time_placebo(fake_treatment_periods=None, zeta_omega_override=None, zeta_lambda_override=None)`**: re-slices the pre-window at each fake treatment period and re-fits both ω and λ via Frank-Wolfe. Default sweeps every feasible pre-period (position index `i ≥ 2` so ≥2 pre-fake periods remain for weight estimation, `i ≤ n_pre - 1` so ≥1 post-fake period exists). Credible designs produce near-zero placebo ATTs; departures indicate pre-treatment dynamics the estimator is picking up.
  - **Note:** Regularization reuses `self.zeta_omega` / `self.zeta_lambda` from the original fit (matches R `synthdid` convention of treating regularization as a property of the fit). `*_override` re-fits with new values.
  - **Note:** Infeasibility-only NaN — the method emits NaN for dimensional infeasibility (e.g., survey composition producing zero weight sum on the fake window); Frank-Wolfe non-convergence is not detectable mid-solver, so `pre_fit_rmse` is the user-facing signal for poor refit quality. Passing a `fake_treatment_period` in `post_periods` raises `ValueError` (not a placebo).
- **`sensitivity_to_zeta_omega(zeta_grid=None, multipliers=(0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0))`**: re-fits ω at each zeta value on the original pre-window. Default grid is `multipliers * self.zeta_omega` — a 5-point grid spanning 16x from smallest to largest multiplier, symmetric in log space around 1.0. Returns `att`, `pre_fit_rmse`, `max_unit_weight`, `effective_n` per row.
  - **Note:** Time weights are held fixed at the original Frank-Wolfe output (`self.time_weights_array`), not re-fit. This isolates sensitivity to `zeta_omega` specifically; sensitivity to `zeta_lambda` is not currently exposed.
  - **Note:** At `multiplier=1.0` (or `zeta_grid` containing `self.zeta_omega`), the ATT reproduces `self.att` to machine precision with the same seeded draw.

**Reference implementation(s):**
- R: `synthdid::synthdid_estimate()` (Arkhangelsky et al.'s official package)
- Key R functions matched: `sc.weight.fw()` (Frank-Wolfe), `sparsify_function` (sparsification), `vcov.synthdid_estimate()` (variance)

**Requirements checklist:**
- [x] Unit weights: Frank-Wolfe on collapsed form (T_pre, N_co+1), two-pass sparsification (100 iters -> sparsify -> 10000 iters)
- [x] Time weights: Frank-Wolfe on collapsed form (N_co, T_pre+1), last column = per-control post mean
- [x] Unit and time weights: sum to 1, non-negative (simplex constraint)
- [x] Auto-regularization: noise_level = sd(first_diffs), zeta_omega = (N1*T1)^0.25 * noise_level, zeta_lambda = 1e-6 * noise_level
- [x] Sparsification: v[v <= max(v)/4] = 0; v = v/sum(v)
- [x] Placebo SE formula: sqrt((r-1)/r) * sd(placebo_estimates)
- [x] Placebo SE: re-estimates omega and lambda per replication (matching R's update.omega=TRUE, update.lambda=TRUE), with R-default warm-start (`init_omega = sum_normalize(unit_weights[pseudo_control_idx])` per draw; `init_lambda = time_weights`) matching `synthdid:::placebo_se`'s `weights.boot$omega = sum_normalize(weights$omega[ind[1:N0_placebo]])` pattern. R-parity verified at `< 1e-8` SE tolerance via `tests/test_methodology_sdid.py::TestJackknifeSERParity::test_placebo_se_matches_r` using R's exact permutation sequence threaded through the `_placebo_indices` test seam.
- [x] Bootstrap: paper-faithful Algorithm 2 step 2 — re-estimates ω̂_b and λ̂_b per draw via two-pass sparsified Frank-Wolfe on the resampled panel using the fit-time normalized-scale zeta. Matches R's default `synthdid::vcov(method="bootstrap")` (which rebinds `attr(estimate, "opts")` so the renormalized ω serves only as Frank-Wolfe initialization). Survey designs (pweight-only AND strata/PSU/FPC) are supported via the weighted-FW + hybrid pairs-bootstrap + Rao-Wu rescaling composition described in the "Note (survey + bootstrap composition)" above (PR #355).
- [x] Placebo: Survey-weighted pseudo-treated means + weighted-FW re-estimation on pseudo-panel for both pweight-only and full-design paths. Full-design path (strata/PSU/FPC) uses stratified-permutation allocator — see "Note (survey + placebo composition)" above.
- [x] Jackknife SE: fixed weights, LOO all units, formula `sqrt((n-1)/n * sum((u-ubar)^2))`. Full-design path (strata/PSU/FPC) uses PSU-level LOO with stratum aggregation — see "Note (survey + jackknife composition)" above.
- [x] Jackknife: NaN SE for single treated or single nonzero-weight control
- [x] Jackknife: analytical p-value (not empirical)
- [x] Returns both unit and time weights for interpretation
- [x] Column centering (intercept=True) in Frank-Wolfe optimization

## TripleDifference

**Key implementation requirements:**

*Assumption checks / warnings:*
- Requires all 8 cells of the 2×2×2 design: Group(0/1) × Period(0/1) × Treatment(0/1)
- Warns if any cell has fewer than threshold observations
- Propensity score overlap required for IPW/DR methods

*Estimator equation (as implemented):*

Three-DiD decomposition (matching R's `triplediff::ddd()`):
```
Subgroups: 4=G1P1, 3=G1P0, 2=G0P1, 1=G0P0
DDD = DiD_3 + DiD_2 - DiD_1
```
where `DiD_j` is a pairwise DiD comparing subgroup j vs subgroup 4 (reference).

Each pairwise DiD uses the selected estimation method (DR, IPW, or RA) with
repeated cross-section implementation (`panel=FALSE` in R).

Regression adjustment (RA): Separate OLS per subgroup-time cell within each
pairwise comparison, imputed counterfactual means.

IPW: Propensity score P(subgroup=4|X) within {j, 4} subset, Hajek normalization.

Doubly robust (DR): Combines outcome regression and IPW with efficiency correction
(OR bias correction term).

*Standard errors (all methods):*

Individual-level (default):
```
SE = std(w₃·IF₃ + w₂·IF₂ - w₁·IF₁, ddof=1) / sqrt(n)
```
where `w_j = n / n_j`, `n_j = |{subgroup=j}| + |{subgroup=4}|`, and `IF_j` is the
per-observation influence function for pairwise DiD j (padded to full n with zeros).

Cluster-robust (when `cluster` parameter is provided):
```
SE = sqrt( (G/(G-1)) * (1/n²) * Σ_c ψ_c² )
```
where `G` is the number of clusters, `ψ_c = Σ_{i∈c} IF_i` is the sum of the combined
influence function within cluster `c`, and the `G/(G-1)` factor is the Liang-Zeger
finite-sample adjustment.

Note: IF-based SEs are inherently heteroskedasticity-robust; the `robust` parameter
has no additional effect.

*Edge cases:*
- Propensity scores near 0/1: trimmed at `pscore_trim` (default 0.01)
- Empty cells: raises ValueError with diagnostic message
- Low cell counts: warns when any cell has fewer than 10 observations
- Cluster-robust SE: requires at least 2 clusters (raises `ValueError`)
- Cluster IDs: must not contain NaN (raises `ValueError`)
- Overlap warning: emitted when >5% of observations are trimmed at pscore bounds (IPW/DR only)
- Propensity score estimation failure: controlled by `pscore_fallback` parameter
  (default `"error"`). If `pscore_fallback="error"`, the error is raised. If
  `pscore_fallback="unconditional"`, falls back to unconditional probability
  P(subgroup=4), sets hessian=None (skipping PS correction in influence
  function), emits UserWarning. When `rank_deficient_action="error"`, errors
  are always re-raised regardless of `pscore_fallback`.
- **Events Per Variable (EPV) diagnostics:** Per-logit EPV =
  min(n_subgroup_j, n_subgroup_4) / n_covariates checked before IRLS.
  Default threshold: 10 (Peduzzi et al. 1996). Warns when EPV < threshold;
  errors when `rank_deficient_action="error"`.
- **Note:** `pscore_fallback` default changed from unconditional to error.
  Set `pscore_fallback="unconditional"` for legacy behavior.
- Collinear covariates: detected via pivoted QR in `solve_ols()`, action controlled by
  `rank_deficient_action` ("warn", "error", "silent")
- Non-finite influence function values (e.g., from extreme propensity scores in IPW/DR
  or near-singular design): warns and sets SE to NaN, propagated to t_stat/p_value/CI
  via safe_inference()
- NaN inference for undefined statistics:
  - t_stat: Uses NaN (not 0.0) when SE is non-finite or zero
  - p_value and CI: Also NaN when t_stat is NaN
  - **Note**: Defensive enhancement; reference implementation behavior not yet documented

**Reference implementation(s):**
- R `triplediff::ddd()` (v0.2.1, CRAN) — official companion by paper authors

**Requirements checklist:**
- [x] All 8 cells (G×P×T) must have observations
- [x] Propensity scores clipped at `pscore_trim` bounds
- [x] Doubly robust consistent if either propensity or outcome model correct
- [x] Returns cell means for diagnostic inspection
- [x] Supports RA, IPW, and DR estimation methods
- [x] Three-DiD decomposition: DDD = DiD_3 + DiD_2 - DiD_1 (matching R)
- [x] Influence function SE: std(w3·IF_3 + w2·IF_2 - w1·IF_1) / sqrt(n)
- [x] Cluster-robust SE via Liang-Zeger variance on influence function
- [x] ATT and SE match R within <0.001% for all methods and DGP types
- [x] Survey design support: all methods (reg, IPW, DR) with weighted OLS/logit + TSL on combined influence functions. Weighted solve_logit() for propensity scores in IPW/DR paths.
- **Note:** TripleDifference survey SE: for IPW/DR, pairwise IFs incorporate survey weights via weighted Riesz representers (`riesz *= weights`), so the combined IF is divided by per-observation survey weights (`inf / sw`) before passing to `compute_survey_vcov()` to prevent double-weighting. For regression (RA), pairwise IFs are already on the unweighted residual scale (WLS fits use weights internally but the IF is not Riesz-multiplied), so the combined IF passes directly to TSL without de-weighting. The OLS nuisance IF corrections in DR mode use weighted cross-products normalized by subgroup row count `n` (not `sum(weights)`).

## StaggeredTripleDifference

**Primary source:** [Ortiz-Villavicencio, M., & Sant'Anna, P.H.C. (2025). Better Understanding Triple Differences Estimators. arXiv:2505.09942.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09942)

**Key implementation requirements:**

*Assumption checks / warnings:*
- Requires balanced panel with enabling-group `S_i`, binary eligibility `Q_i` (time-invariant), and outcome `Y`
- Eligibility must be binary (0/1) — raises `ValueError` if not
- Eligibility must be time-invariant within each unit — raises `ValueError` if varying
- Requires both eligible (Q=1) and ineligible (Q=0) units
- Warns if any (S, Q) cell in a three-DiD comparison has < 5 units
- Warns if no valid comparison groups exist for a (g, t) pair (skips that pair)
- Propensity score overlap enforced by clipping at `pscore_trim` (default 0.01)
- **Events Per Variable (EPV) diagnostics:** Per-DiD EPV =
  min(n_subgroup_j, n_subgroup_4) / n_covariates checked before IRLS.
  Default threshold: 10 (Peduzzi et al. 1996). Warns when EPV < threshold;
  errors when `rank_deficient_action="error"`.
- **Note:** When multiple comparison cohorts `g_c` contribute to the same
  ATT(g,t) cell, `results.epv_diagnostics[(g,t)]` retains the worst-case
  (minimum EPV) across all contributing propensity fits, rather than per-fit
  diagnostics. This is a conservative cell-level summary.
- Propensity score estimation failure: controlled by `pscore_fallback` parameter
  (default `"error"`). If `pscore_fallback="error"`, the error is raised. If
  `pscore_fallback="unconditional"`, falls back to unconditional propensity with
  warning. When `rank_deficient_action="error"`, errors are always re-raised.
- **Note:** `pscore_fallback` default changed from unconditional to error.
  Set `pscore_fallback="unconditional"` for legacy behavior.
- Warns on singular GMM covariance matrix (falls back to pseudoinverse)
- **Note:** Rank-deficient X'WX in the per-pair outcome-regression influence-function step now emits ONE aggregate `UserWarning` at `fit()` time (counting affected (g, g_c, t) cells and reporting the max condition number), instead of silently falling back to `np.linalg.lstsq`. Axis-A finding #17 in the Phase 2 silent-failures audit.
- **Note:** The per-pair propensity-score Hessian inversion in `_compute_pscore` (used under `estimation_method` in `{ipw, dr}`) previously fell back from `np.linalg.inv(X'WX)` to `np.linalg.lstsq` silently. `fit()` now emits a sibling aggregate `UserWarning` with cell count + max condition number so rank-deficient PS designs can't quietly degrade IPW/DR influence-function corrections. Sibling of axis-A finding #17, surfaced during PR #334 CI review.

*Data structure:*

Balanced panel. Key variables:
- `S_i` (`first_treat`): enabling group — 0 or inf for never-enabled
- `Q_i` (`eligibility`): binary, time-invariant eligibility indicator
- Treatment: `D_{i,t} = 1{t >= S_i AND Q_i = 1}` (absorbing)
- Covariates `X_i`: time-invariant (first observation per unit used)
- **Note:** `first_treat=inf` (R-style never-enabled marker) is accepted and normalized to `0` internally. The recoding now emits a `UserWarning` reporting the affected row count so the reclassification is not silent (axis-E silent coercion under the Phase 2 audit, mirroring the StaggeredDiD behavior). Pass `first_treat=0` directly to avoid the warning.

*Estimator equation (Equation 4.1 in paper, as implemented):*

Three-DiD decomposition for each (g, g_c, t) triple:

```
DDD(g, g_c, t) = DiD_A + DiD_B - DiD_C
```

where each pairwise DiD operates on panel outcome changes `delta_Y = Y_t - Y_b`:
- DiD_A: treated (S=g, Q=1) vs (S=g, Q=0)     [+1, paper Term 1]
- DiD_B: treated (S=g, Q=1) vs (S=g_c, Q=1)   [+1, paper Term 2]
- DiD_C: treated (S=g, Q=1) vs (S=g_c, Q=0)   [-1, paper Term 3]

This sign convention matches both the paper's Equation 4.1 and the existing
`TripleDifference` decomposition (DDD = DiD_3 + DiD_2 - DiD_1 with subgroups
4=G1P1, 3=G1P0, 2=G0P1, 1=G0P0).

Valid comparison groups: for `control_group="nevertreated"`, only the never-enabled
cohort (S=0). For `control_group="notyettreated"`, `G_c = {g_c : g_c > max(t, base_period)
+ anticipation}`, plus never-enabled.

- **Deviation from paper:** The paper's Section 4 defines admissible comparison cohorts
  as `g_c > max(g, t)`. The implementation follows the companion R package `triplediff`
  which uses `g_c > max(t, base_period) + anticipation`. These rules differ for
  pre-treatment cells (`t < g`) when a later cohort lies in `(t, g)`: the paper would
  exclude it, while the R package (and this implementation) may include it depending
  on the base period. The R-matching rule correctly accounts for the anticipation
  parameter and base-period selection in the comparison-group filter.

*With covariates / doubly robust (DR, recommended):*

Each pairwise DiD uses the CallawaySantAnna DR estimator on outcome changes:
1. Fit outcome regression `E[delta_Y | X]` on control units (OLS)
2. Estimate propensity score `P(treated | X)` within each 2-cell subset (logistic)
3. Combine: `ATT = mean(treated_change - m_hat) + sum(w_ipw * (m_hat - control_change)) / n_t`

*GMM-optimal combination across comparison groups (Equations 4.11-4.12):*

```
ATT_gmm(g,t) = w_gmm' @ [ATT_1, ..., ATT_k]
w_gmm = Omega^{-1} @ 1 / (1' @ Omega^{-1} @ 1)
```

where `Omega[j,l] = (1/n) * sum_i IF_j[i] * IF_l[i]` is estimated from influence
functions across comparison groups. Minimizes asymptotic variance subject to `sum(w) = 1`.

*Aggregation:*

Event study (Equation 4.13): cohort-share-weighted average across cohorts for each
relative time `e = t - g`. Reuses `CallawaySantAnnaAggregationMixin._aggregate_event_study()`.

Overall ATT: cohort-size-weighted average across post-treatment (g,t) pairs.
Reuses `CallawaySantAnnaAggregationMixin._aggregate_simple()`. Note: this is the
simple post-treatment aggregation, not the paper's Equation 4.14 (which averages
over event-study effects).

Group effects: average across post-treatment time periods for each cohort.
Reuses `CallawaySantAnnaAggregationMixin._aggregate_by_group()`.

All aggregation SEs include the WIF (Weight Influence Function) adjustment for
uncertainty in cohort-share weights, inherited from the CallawaySantAnna mixin.

- **Deviation from R:** Aggregation weights and WIF use the eligible-treated
  population `P(S=g, Q=1)` (matching the paper's Eq 4.13, where `G_i` is defined
  only for `Q=1` units). R's `agg_ddd()` uses `P(S=g)` (all units in the enabling
  group, including ineligible). This is implemented by setting `unit_cohorts=0` for
  ineligible units before calling the aggregation mixin.
- **Note:** Per-cohort group-effect SEs include WIF via the inherited mixin.
  R's `agg_ddd(type="group")` uses `wif=NULL` for per-cohort aggregation since
  within-cohort weights are fixed. This makes our per-cohort group-effect SEs
  slightly conservative relative to R.

*Standard errors:*

Individual (g,t) level:
```
SE(g,t) = std(IF_gmm, ddof=1) / sqrt(n)
```
where `IF_gmm = w_gmm' @ IF_matrix` is the GMM-combined unit-level influence function
(length n_units, zero-padded for non-participating units). Inherently
heteroskedasticity-robust via the influence function approach.

Aggregation SEs: via WIF-adjusted combined influence functions from the
CallawaySantAnna aggregation mixin.

Bootstrap: multiplier bootstrap (Algorithm 1 of Callaway & Sant'Anna 2021) via
`CallawaySantAnnaBootstrapMixin._run_multiplier_bootstrap()`. Supports
Rademacher, Mammen, and Webb weight distributions. Provides simultaneous
confidence bands (sup-t) for event study.

- **Note:** Matches R `triplediff` package `compute_did()` formulation:
  Hajek-normalized Riesz representers, separate M1/M3 OR corrections on
  treated/control IF components, PS correction via logistic Hessian and score
  function, hessian = (X'WX)^{-1} * n_pair. Three-DiD IF combination weights
  use `w_j = n_cell / n_pair_j` (matching R's att_dr). GMM Omega estimated via
  sample covariance (ddof=1). Per-(g,t) SE uses R's GMM formula
  `sqrt(1 / (n * sum(Omega_inv)))` for multiple comparison groups, or
  `sqrt(sum(IF^2) / n^2)` for single comparison group.
- **Deviation from R:** Propensity scores are clipped to `[pscore_trim, 1-pscore_trim]`
  (default 0.01). R's `triplediff` uses hard exclusion (`keep_ps`) for control units
  with `pscore >= 0.995` but does not apply a lower bound. The soft-clipping approach
  retains all observations with bounded weights, which is more conservative under
  moderate overlap violations.
- **Note:** The `cluster` parameter is accepted but not currently wired to the
  analytical SE computation. The multiplier bootstrap provides unit-level
  clustering. Full cluster-robust analytical SEs are deferred.
- **Note:** Full survey design support (pweight only). Survey weights enter
  propensity score estimation (weighted IRLS), outcome regression (WLS), and
  Riesz representer computation. IF combination weights (w1/w2/w3) use
  survey-weighted cell sizes. Aggregated SEs use `compute_survey_if_variance()`
  (TSL) or `compute_replicate_if_variance()` (replicate weights). Bootstrap
  uses PSU-level multiplier weights. The R `triplediff` package does not
  support survey weights.
- **Deviation from R:** Event-study and simple aggregation reuse
  `CallawaySantAnnaAggregationMixin` cohort-size weights (`n_treated` per cohort)
  instead of R's `agg_ddd()` group-probability weights (`pg = P(G=g)` over all
  units including ineligible). Group-time ATT(g,t) values are identical; only the
  weighted average across (g,t) pairs differs.

*Edge cases:*
- Single comparison group: GMM reduces to w=[1], no matrix inversion
- Zero valid comparison groups for a (g,t): skipped with warning
- Singular GMM covariance: falls back to pseudoinverse with warning
- Small cells (< 5 units): warns but proceeds
- Non-finite ATT from a comparison group: excluded from GMM combination
- Never-enabled encoded as inf: normalized to 0 internally
- No valid (g,t) pairs at all: raises `ValueError`

**Reference implementation(s):**
- R `triplediff` (companion package by paper authors) — not yet validated against

**Requirements checklist:**
- [x] Panel data with (unit, time, enabling-group S, eligibility Q, outcome Y)
- [x] Three comparison sub-groups per (g, g_c): (S=g, Q=0), (S=g_c, Q=1), (S=g_c, Q=0)
- [x] Individual comparison cohorts, never pooled — combined via GMM weights
- [x] Comparison groups satisfy g_c > max(t, base_period) + anticipation (notyettreated)
  or g_c = never-enabled only (nevertreated)
- [x] Doubly robust: consistent if either propensity or outcome model correct (per component)
- [x] GMM-optimal weighting via closed-form inverse-variance formula
- [x] Event-study aggregation with cohort-share weights (via CS mixin)
- [x] Pre-treatment event-study coefficients constructable
- [x] Influence-function-based SEs
- [x] Multiplier bootstrap for simultaneous confidence bands (via CS mixin)
- [ ] Cluster-robust analytical SEs (accepted but not wired — deferred)
- [x] Survey design support (pweight, strata/PSU/FPC, replicate weights)
- [x] Validation against R `triplediff` package: group-time ATT and SE match within
  0.001% across 10 scenarios (3 seeds, 3 methods, both control group modes).
  Aggregation (event study, overall ATT) uses CS mixin cohort-size weights which
  differ from R's `agg_ddd()` group-probability weights (within 25%); this is a
  documented weighting choice, not a specification violation.

**Key implementation requirements:**

*Assumption checks / warnings:*
- Requires sufficient pre-treatment periods for factor estimation (at least 2)
- Warns if estimated rank seems too high/low relative to panel dimensions
- Unit weights can become degenerate if λ_unit too large
- Returns Q(λ) = ∞ if ANY LOOCV fit fails (Equation 5 compliance)

*Treatment indicator (D matrix) semantics:*

D must be an **ABSORBING STATE** indicator, not a treatment timing indicator:
- D[t, i] = 0 for all t < g_i (pre-treatment periods for unit i)
- D[t, i] = 1 for all t >= g_i (during and after treatment for unit i)

where g_i is the treatment start time for unit i.

For staggered adoption, different units have different treatment start times g_i.
The D matrix naturally handles this - distances use periods where BOTH units
have D=0, matching the paper's (1 - W_iu)(1 - W_ju) formula in Equation 3.

**Wrong D specification**: If user provides event-style D (only first treatment period
has D=1), ATT will be incorrect - document this clearly.

*ATT definition (Equation 1, Section 6.1):*
```
τ̂ = (1 / Σ_i Σ_t W_{it}) Σ_{i=1}^N Σ_{t=1}^T W_{it} τ̂_{it}(λ̂)
```
- ATT averages over ALL cells where D_it=1 (treatment indicator)
- No separate "post_periods" concept - D matrix is the sole input for treatment timing
- Supports general assignment patterns including staggered adoption

*Estimator equation (as implemented, Section 2.2):*

Working model (separating unit/time FE from regularized factor component):
```
Y_it(0) = α_i + β_t + L_it + ε_it,   E[ε_it | L] = 0
```
where α_i are unit fixed effects, β_t are time fixed effects, and L = UΣV' is a low-rank
factor structure. The FE are estimated separately from L because L is regularized but
the fixed effects are not.

Optimization (Equation 2):
```
(α̂, β̂, L̂) = argmin_{α,β,L} Σ_j Σ_s θ_s^{i,t} ω_j^{i,t} (1-W_js)(Y_js - α_j - β_s - L_js)² + λ_nn ||L||_*
```
Solved via alternating minimization. For α, β: weighted least squares (closed form).
The global solver adds an intercept μ and solves for (μ, α, β, L) on control data only,
extracting τ_it post-hoc as residuals (see Global section below).
For L: proximal gradient with step size η = 1/(2·max(W)):
```
Gradient step: G = L + (W/max(W)) ⊙ (R - L)
Proximal step: L = U × soft_threshold(Σ, η·λ_nn) × V'  (SVD of G = UΣV')
```
where R is the residual after removing fixed effects.
Both the local and global solvers use FISTA/Nesterov acceleration for the
inner L update (O(1/k²) convergence rate, up to 20 inner iterations per
outer alternating step).

Per-observation weights (Equation 3):
```
θ_s^{i,t}(λ) = exp(-λ_time × |t - s|)

ω_j^{i,t}(λ) = exp(-λ_unit × dist^unit_{-t}(j, i))

dist^unit_{-t}(j, i) = (Σ_u 1{u≠t}(1-W_iu)(1-W_ju)(Y_iu - Y_ju)² / Σ_u 1{u≠t}(1-W_iu)(1-W_ju))^{1/2}
```
Note: weights are per-(i,t) observation-specific. The distance formula excludes the
target period t and uses only periods where both units are untreated (W=0).

*Special cases (Section 2.2):*
- λ_nn=∞, ω_j=θ_s=1 (uniform weights) → recovers DID/TWFE
- ω_j=θ_s=1, λ_nn<∞ → recovers Matrix Completion (Athey et al. 2021)
- λ_nn=∞ with specific ω_j, θ_s → recovers SC/SDID

*LOOCV tuning parameter selection (Equation 5, Footnote 2):*
```
Q(λ) = Σ_{j,s: D_js=0} [τ̂_js^loocv(λ)]²
```
- Score is **SUM** of squared pseudo-treatment effects on control observations
- **Two-stage procedure** (per paper's footnote 2):
  - Stage 1: Univariate grid searches with extreme fixed values
    - λ_time search: fix λ_unit=0, λ_nn=∞ (disabled)
    - λ_nn search: fix λ_time=0 (uniform time weights), λ_unit=0
    - λ_unit search: fix λ_nn=∞, λ_time=0
  - Stage 2: Cycling (coordinate descent) until convergence
- **"Disabled" parameter semantics** (per paper Section 4.3, Table 5, Footnote 2):
  - `λ_time=0`: Uniform time weights (disabled), because exp(-0 × dist) = 1
  - `λ_unit=0`: Uniform unit weights (disabled), because exp(-0 × dist) = 1
  - `λ_nn=∞`: Factor model disabled (L=0), because infinite penalty; converted to `1e10` internally
  - **Note**: `λ_nn=0` means NO regularization (full-rank L), which is the OPPOSITE of "disabled"
  - **Validation**: `lambda_time_grid` and `lambda_unit_grid` must not contain inf. A `ValueError` is raised if they do, guiding users to use 0.0 for uniform weights per Eq. 3.
- **LOOCV failure handling** (Equation 5 compliance):
  - If ANY LOOCV fit fails for a parameter combination, Q(λ) = ∞
  - A warning is emitted on the first failure with the observation (t, i) and λ values
  - Subsequent failures for the same λ are not individually warned (early return)
  - This ensures λ selection only considers fully estimable combinations

*Standard errors:*
- Block bootstrap preserving panel structure (Algorithm 3)

*Edge cases:*
- Rank selection: automatic via cross-validation, information criterion, or elbow
- Zero singular values: handled by soft-thresholding
- Extreme distances: weights regularized to prevent degeneracy
- LOOCV fit failures: returns Q(λ) = ∞ on first failure (per Equation 5 requirement that Q sums over ALL control observations where D==0); if all parameter combinations fail, falls back to defaults (1.0, 1.0, 0.1)
- **λ_nn=∞ implementation**: Only λ_nn uses infinity (converted to 1e10 for computation):
  - λ_nn=∞ → 1e10 (large penalty → L≈0, factor model disabled)
  - Conversion applied to grid values during LOOCV (including Rust backend)
  - Conversion applied to selected values for point estimation
  - Conversion applied to selected values for variance estimation (ensures SE matches ATT)
  - **Results storage**: `TROPResults` stores *original* λ_nn value (inf), while computations use 1e10. λ_time and λ_unit store their selected values directly (0.0 = uniform).
- **Empty control observations**: If no valid control observations exist, returns Q(λ) = ∞ with warning. A score of 0.0 would incorrectly "win" over legitimate parameters.
- **Infinite LOOCV score handling**: If best LOOCV score is infinite, `best_lambda` is set to None, triggering defaults fallback
- Validation: requires at least 2 periods before first treatment
- **D matrix validation**: Treatment indicator must be an absorbing state (monotonic non-decreasing per unit)
  - Detection: `np.diff(D, axis=0) < 0` for any column indicates violation
  - Handling: Raises `ValueError` with list of violating unit IDs and remediation guidance
  - Error message includes: "convert to absorbing state: D[t, i] = 1 for all t >= first treatment period"
  - **Rationale**: Event-style D (0→1→0) silently biases ATT; runtime validation prevents misuse
  - **Unbalanced panels**: Missing unit-period observations are allowed. Monotonicity validation checks each unit's *observed* D sequence for monotonicity, which correctly catches 1→0 violations that span missing period gaps (e.g., D[2]=1, missing [3,4], D[5]=0 is detected as a violation even though the gap hides the transition in adjacent-period checks).
  - **n_post_periods metadata**: Counts periods where D=1 is actually observed (at least one unit has D=1), not calendar periods from first treatment. In unbalanced panels where treated units are missing in some post-treatment periods, only periods with observed D=1 values are counted.
- Wrong D specification: if user provides event-style D (only first treatment period),
  the absorbing-state validation will raise ValueError with helpful guidance
- **Bootstrap minimum**: `n_bootstrap` must be >= 2 (enforced via `ValueError`). TROP uses bootstrap for all variance estimation — there is no analytical SE formula.
- **Note:** TROP bootstrap loops (`_bootstrap_variance`, `_bootstrap_rao_wu`, and their global counterparts, including both Rust happy paths — local and global) emit a proportional `UserWarning` via `diff_diff.bootstrap_utils.warn_bootstrap_failure_rate` when the replicate failure rate exceeds 5%. The previous hard-coded `< 10 successes` threshold let high-failure runs (e.g. 11 of 200) pass silently; this was classified as a silent failure under the Phase 2 audit (axis D — degenerate-replicate handling). The 5% threshold matches the existing SyntheticDiD bootstrap and placebo guards. When zero replicates succeed, SE is set to `NaN` (unchanged). The local Rust path previously also used `len >= 10` as a Python-fallback trigger; it now accepts any non-zero Rust result and emits the proportional warning instead of path-switching silently.
- **LOOCV failure metadata**: When LOOCV fits fail in the Rust backend, the first failed observation coordinates (t, i) are returned to Python for informative warning messages
- **Inference CI distribution**: After `safe_inference()` migration, CI uses t-distribution (df = max(1, n_treated_obs - 1)), consistent with p_value. Previously CI used normal-distribution while p_value used t-distribution (inconsistent). This is a minor behavioral change; CIs may be slightly wider for small n_treated_obs.
- **Note:** Both the `local` alternating-minimization solver (`_estimate_model`) and the `global` alternating-minimization solver (`_solve_global_with_lowrank`, including its hard-coded inner FISTA loop of 20 iterations) emit `UserWarning` via `diff_diff.utils.warn_if_not_converged` when the outer loop exhausts `max_iter` without reaching `tol`. The global-method warning surfaces the inner-FISTA non-convergence count as diagnostic context. Silent return of the current iterate was classified as a silent failure under the Phase 2 audit and replaced with an explicit signal to match the convention used across other iterative solvers in the library.

**Reference implementation(s):**
- Authors' replication code (forthcoming)

**Requirements checklist:**
- [x] Factor matrix estimated via soft-threshold SVD
- [x] Unit weights: `exp(-λ_unit × distance)` (unnormalized, matching Eq. 2)
- [x] LOOCV implemented for tuning parameter selection
- [x] LOOCV uses SUM of squared errors per Equation 5
- [x] Multiple rank selection methods: cv, ic, elbow
- [x] Returns factor loadings and scores for interpretation
- [x] ATT averages over all D==1 cells (general assignment patterns)
- [x] No post_periods parameter (D matrix determines treatment timing)
- [x] D matrix semantics documented (absorbing state, not event indicator)
- [x] Unbalanced panels supported (missing observations don't trigger false violations)
- **Note:** Survey support: weights, strata, PSU, and FPC are all supported via Rao-Wu rescaled bootstrap with cross-classified pseudo-strata (Phase 6). Rust backend remains pweight-only; full-design surveys fall back to the Python bootstrap path. Survey weights enter ATT aggregation only — population-weighted average of per-observation treatment effects. Model fitting (kernel weights, LOOCV, nuclear norm regularization) stays unchanged. Rust and Python bootstrap paths both support survey-weighted ATT in each iteration.

### TROP Global Estimation Method

**Method**: `method="global"` in TROP estimator

**Approach**: Computationally efficient adaptation using the (1-W) masking
principle from Eq. 2. Fits a single global model on control data, then
extracts treatment effects as post-hoc residuals. For the paper's full
per-treated-cell estimator (Algorithm 2), use `method='local'`.

**Objective function** (Equation G1):
```
min_{μ, α, β, L}  Σ_{i,t} (1-W_{it}) × δ_{it} × (Y_{it} - μ - α_i - β_t - L_{it})² + λ_nn×||L||_*
```

where:
- (1-W_{it}) masks out treated observations — model is fit on control data only
- δ_{it} = δ_time(t) × δ_unit(i) are observation weights (product of time and unit weights)
- μ is the intercept
- α_i are unit fixed effects
- β_t are time fixed effects
- L_{it} is the low-rank factor component

**Post-hoc treatment effect extraction**:
```
τ̂_{it} = Y_{it} - μ̂ - α̂_i - β̂_t - L̂_{it}    for all (i,t) where W_{it} = 1
ATT = mean(τ̂_{it})  over all treated observations
```

Treatment effects are **heterogeneous** per-observation values. ATT is their mean.

**Weight computation** (differs from local):
- Time weights: δ_time(t) = exp(-λ_time × |t - center|) where center = T - treated_periods/2
- Unit weights: δ_unit(i) = exp(-λ_unit × RMSE(i, treated_avg))
  where RMSE is computed over pre-treatment periods comparing to average treated trajectory
- (1-W) masking applied after outer product: δ_{it} = 0 for all treated cells

**Implementation approach** (without CVXPY):

1. **Without low-rank (λ_nn = ∞)**: Standard weighted least squares
   - Build design matrix with unit/time dummies (no treatment indicator)
   - Solve via np.linalg.lstsq for (μ, α, β) using (1-W)-masked weights
   - Both the Python fallback and the Rust acceleration path use SVD-based
     minimum-norm least squares with numpy-compatible rcond = eps × max(n, k),
     so they return the canonical minimum-norm solution on rank-deficient Y
     (e.g., two near-parallel control units)

2. **With low-rank (finite λ_nn)**: Alternating minimization
   - Alternate between:
     - Fix L, solve weighted LS for (μ, α, β)
     - Fix (μ, α, β), proximal gradient for L:
       - Lipschitz constant of ∇f is L_f = 2·max(δ)
       - Step size η = 1/L_f = 1/(2·max(δ))
       - Proximal operator: soft_threshold(gradient_step, η·λ_nn)
       - Inner solver uses FISTA/Nesterov acceleration (O(1/k²))
   - Continue until max(|L_new - L_old|) < tol

3. **Post-hoc**: Extract τ̂_{it} = Y_{it} - μ̂ - α̂_i - β̂_t - L̂_{it} for treated cells

**LOOCV parameter selection** (unified with local, Equation 5):
Following paper's Equation 5 and footnote 2:
```
Q(λ) = Σ_{j,s: D_js=0} [τ̂_js^loocv(λ)]²
```
where τ̂_js^loocv is the pseudo-treatment effect at control observation (j,s)
with that observation excluded from fitting.

For global method, LOOCV works as follows:
1. For each control observation (t, i):
   - Zero out weight δ_{ti} = 0 (exclude from weighted objective)
   - Fit global model on remaining data → obtain (μ̂, α̂, β̂, L̂)
   - Compute pseudo-treatment: τ̂_{ti} = Y_{ti} - μ̂ - α̂_i - β̂_t - L̂_{ti}
2. Score = Σ τ̂_{ti}² (sum of squared pseudo-treatment effects)
3. Select λ combination that minimizes Q(λ)

**Rust acceleration**: The LOOCV grid search is parallelized in Rust for 5-10x speedup.
- `loocv_grid_search_global()` - Parallel LOOCV across all λ combinations
- `bootstrap_trop_variance_global()` - Parallel bootstrap variance estimation

**Key differences from local method**:
- Global weights (distance to treated block center) vs. per-observation weights
- Single model fit per λ combination vs. N_treated fits
- Treatment effects are post-hoc residuals from a single global model (global)
  vs. post-hoc residuals from per-observation models (local)
- Both use (1-W) masking (control-only fitting)
- Faster computation for large panels

**Assumptions**:
- **Simultaneous adoption (enforced)**: The global method requires all treated units
  to receive treatment at the same time. A `ValueError` is raised if staggered
  adoption is detected (units first treated at different periods). Treatment timing is
  inferred once and held constant for bootstrap variance estimation.
  For staggered adoption designs, use `method="local"`.

**Reference**: Adapted from reference implementation. See also Athey et al. (2025).

**Edge Cases (treated NaN outcomes):**
- **Partial NaN**: When some treated outcomes Y_{it} are NaN/missing:
  - `_extract_posthoc_tau()` (global) skips these cells; only finite τ̂ values are averaged
  - Local loop skips NaN outcomes entirely (no model fit, no tau appended)
  - `n_treated_obs` in results reflects valid (finite) count, not total D==1 count
  - `df_trop = max(1, n_valid_treated - 1)` uses valid count
  - Warning issued when n_valid_treated < total treated count
- **All NaN**: When all treated outcomes are NaN:
  - ATT = NaN, warning issued
  - `n_treated_obs = 0`
- **Bootstrap SE with <2 draws**: Returns `se=NaN` (not 0.0) when zero bootstrap
  iterations succeed. `safe_inference()` propagates NaN downstream.

**Requirements checklist:**
- [x] Same LOOCV framework as local (Equation 5)
- [x] Global weight computation using treated block center
- [x] (1-W) masking for control-only fitting (per paper Eq. 2)
- [x] Alternating minimization for nuclear norm penalty
- [x] Returns ATT = mean of per-observation post-hoc τ̂_{it}
- [x] Rust acceleration for LOOCV and bootstrap

## HeterogeneousAdoptionDiD

**Implementation status (2026-04-18):** Methodology plan approved; implementation queued across 7 phased PRs (Phase 1a kernels + local-linear + HC2/Bell-McCaffrey; Phase 1b MSE-optimal bandwidth; Phase 1c bias-corrected CI + `nprobust` parity; Phase 2 `HeterogeneousAdoptionDiD` class + multi-period event study; Phase 3 QUG/Stute/Yatchew-HR diagnostics; Phase 4 Pierce-Schott replication harness; Phase 5 docs + tutorial + `practitioner_next_steps` integration). Full plan at `~/.claude/plans/vectorized-beaming-feather.md`; full paper review at `docs/methodology/papers/dechaisemartin-2026-review.md`. The requirements checklist at the end of this section tracks phase completion.

**Primary source:** de Chaisemartin, C., Ciccia, D., D'Haultfœuille, X., & Knau, F. (2026). Difference-in-Differences Estimators When No Unit Remains Untreated. arXiv:2405.04465v6.

**Scope:** Heterogeneous Adoption Design (HAD): a single-date, two-period DiD setting in which no unit is treated at period one and at period two all units receive strictly positive, heterogeneous treatment doses `D_{g,2} >= 0`. The estimator targets a Weighted Average Slope (WAS) when no genuinely untreated group exists. Extensions cover multiple periods without variation in treatment timing (Appendix B.2) and covariate-adjusted identification (Appendix B.1, future work).

**Key implementation requirements:**

*Assumption checks / warnings:*
- Data must be panel (or repeated cross-section) with `D_{g,1} = 0` for all `g` (nobody treated in period one).
- Treatment dose `D_{g,2} >= 0`. For Design 1' (the QUG case) the support infimum `d̲ := inf Supp(D_{g,2})` must equal 0; for Design 1 (no QUG) `d̲ > 0` and Assumption 5 or 6 must be invoked.
- Assumption 1 (i.i.d. sample): `(Y_{g,1}, Y_{g,2}, D_{g,1}, D_{g,2})_{g=1,...,G}` i.i.d.
- Assumption 2 (parallel trends for the least-treated): `lim_{d ↓ d̲} E[ΔY(0) | D_2 ≤ d] = E[ΔY(0)]`. Testable with pre-trends when a pre-treatment period `t=0` exists. Reduces to standard parallel trends when treatment is binary.
- Assumption 3 (uniform continuity of `d → Y_2(d)` at zero): excludes extensive-margin effects; holds if `d → Y_2(d)` is Lipschitz. Not testable.
- Assumption 4 (regularity for nonparametric estimation): positive density at boundary (`lim_{d ↓ 0} f_{D_2}(d) > 0`), twice-differentiable `m(d) := E[ΔY | D_2 = d]` near 0, continuous `σ²(d) := V(ΔY | D_2 = d)` with `lim_{d ↓ 0} σ²(d) > 0`, bounded kernel, bandwidth `h_G → 0` with `G h_G → ∞`.
- Assumption 5 (for Design 1 sign identification): `lim_{d ↓ d̲} E(TE_2 | D_2 ≤ d) / WAS < E(D_2) / d̲`. Not testable via pre-trends. Sufficient version Equation 9: `0 ≤ E(TE_2 | D_2 = d) / E(TE_2 | D_2 = d') < E(D_2) / d̲` for all `(d, d')` in `Supp(D_2)²`.
- Assumption 6 (for Design 1 WAS_{d̲} identification): `lim_{d ↓ d̲} E[Y_2(d̲) - Y_2(0) | D_2 ≤ d] = E[Y_2(d̲) - Y_2(0)]`. Not testable.
- Warn (do NOT fit silently) when staggered treatment timing is detected: the paper's Appendix B.2 excludes designs with variation in treatment timing and no untreated group (only the last treatment cohort's effects are identified in a staggered setting).
- Warn when Assumption 5/6 is invoked that these are not testable via pre-trends.
- With Design 1 (no QUG) WAS is NOT point-identified under Assumptions 1-3 alone (Proposition 1); only sign identification (Theorem 2) or the alternative target WAS_{d̲} (Theorem 3) is available.

*Target parameter - Weighted Average Slope (WAS, Equation 2):*

    WAS := E[(D_2 / E[D_2]) · TE_2]
         = E[Y_2(D_2) - Y_2(0)] / E[D_2]

where `TE_2 := (Y_2(D_2) - Y_2(0)) / D_2` is the per-unit slope relative to "no treatment". Authors prefer WAS over the unweighted Average Slope `AS := E[TE_2]` because AS suffers a small-denominator problem near `D_2 = 0` that prevents `√G`-rate estimation.

Alternative target (Design 1 under Assumption 6):

    WAS_{d̲} := E[(D_2 - d̲) / E[D_2 - d̲] · TE_{2,d̲}]

where `TE_{2,d̲} := (Y_2(D_2) - Y_2(d̲)) / (D_2 - d̲)`. Compares to a counterfactual where every unit gets the lowest dose, not zero; authors describe it as "less policy-relevant" than WAS.

*Estimator equations:*

Design 1' identification (Theorem 1, Equation 3):

    WAS = (E[ΔY] - lim_{d ↓ 0} E[ΔY | D_2 ≤ d]) / E[D_2]

Nonparametric local-linear estimator (Equation 7):

    β̂_{h*_G}^{np} := ((1/G) Σ_{g=1}^G ΔY_g  -  μ̂_{h*_G}) / ((1/G) Σ_{g=1}^G D_{g,2})

where `μ̂_h` is the intercept from a local-linear regression of `ΔY_g` on `D_{g,2}` using weights `k(D_{g,2}/h)/h`. This estimates the conditional mean `m(0) = lim_{d ↓ 0} E[ΔY | D_2 ≤ d]`.

Design 1 mass-point case (Section 3.2.4, discrete bunching at `d̲`):

    target = (E[ΔY] - E[ΔY | D_2 = d̲]) / E[D_2 - d̲]
           = (E[ΔY | D_2 > d̲] - E[ΔY | D_2 = d̲]) / (E[D_2 | D_2 > d̲] - E[D_2 | D_2 = d̲])

Compute via sample averages or a 2SLS of `ΔY` on `D_2` with instrument `1{D_2 > d̲}`. Convergence rate is `√G`.

Design 1 continuous-near-`d̲` case: use the same kernel construction as Equation 7 with 0 replaced by `d̲` and `D_2` replaced by `D_2 - d̲`. `d̲` is estimated by `min_g D_{g,2}`, which converges at rate `G` (asymptotically negligible versus the `G^{2/5}` nonparametric rate of `β̂_{h*_G}^{np}`).

Sign identification for Design 1 (Theorem 2, Equation 10):

    WAS ≥ 0  ⟺  (E[ΔY] - lim_{d ↓ d̲} E[ΔY | D_2 ≤ d]) / E[D_2 - d̲] ≥ 0

WAS_{d̲} identification (Theorem 3, Equation 11):

    WAS_{d̲} = (E[ΔY] - lim_{d ↓ d̲} E[ΔY | D_2 ≤ d]) / E[D_2 - d̲]

*With covariates / conditional identification (Equation 19, Appendix B.1):*

Assumption 9 (conditional parallel trends): almost surely, `lim_{d ↓ 0} E[ΔY(0) | D_2 ≤ d, X] = E[ΔY(0) | X]`.

Theorem 6 (Design 1' + Assumptions 3 and 9):

    WAS = (E[ΔY] - E[ lim_{d ↓ 0} E[ΔY | D_2 ≤ d, X] ]) / E[D_2]

Implementing Equation 19 requires MULTIVARIATE nonparametric regression `E[ΔY | D_2, X]`; Calonico et al. (2018) covers only the univariate case, so the authors leave this extension to future work. The Phase-2 estimator will raise `NotImplementedError` when `covariates=` is passed, pointing to this section.

TWFE-with-covariates (Appendix B.1, Equations 20-21): under linearity Assumption 10 (`E[ΔY(0) | D_2, X] = X' γ_0`) and homogeneity `E[TE_2 | D_2, X] = X' δ_0`,

    E[ΔY | D_2, X] = X' γ_0 + D_2 X' δ_0    (21)

so `δ_0` is recovered by OLS of `ΔY` on `X` and `D_2 * X`; Average Slope is `((1/n) Σ X_i)' δ̂^X`.

*Standard errors (Section 3.1.3-3.1.4, 4):*

- Nonparametric estimator (Design 1' and Design 1 continuous-near-`d̲`): bias-corrected Calonico-Cattaneo-Farrell (2018, 2019) 95% CI (Equation 8):

      [ β̂_{ĥ*_G}^{np} + M̂_{ĥ*_G} / ((1/G) Σ D_{g,2})  ±  q_{1-α/2} sqrt(V̂_{ĥ*_G} / (G ĥ*_G)) / ((1/G) Σ D_{g,2}) ]

  The procedure ports the Calonico et al. `nprobust` machinery in-house (Phase 1a/1b/1c of the implementation plan): estimate optimal bandwidth `ĥ*_G`, compute `μ̂_{ĥ*_G}`, the first-order bias estimator `M̂_{ĥ*_G}`, and the variance estimator `V̂_{ĥ*_G}`.

*Weighted extension (Phase 4.5 survey support):* `HeterogeneousAdoptionDiD.fit()` accepts `weights=<array>` (pweight shortcut) and `survey=SurveyDesign(...)` (design-based inference) on the two continuous-dose paths (`continuous_at_zero`, `continuous_near_d_lower`). Weights thread through `_nprobust_port.lprobust` via pointwise multiplication into the kernel weights: `W_combined = k((D − d̲)/h) · w_g`. Design matrices, Q.q bias-correction matrix, and variance matrices inherit the combined weights automatically. The β-scale rescaling uses weighted population moments: β̂_weighted = (Σ w_g ΔY_g / Σ w_g − μ̂_weighted(h)) / (Σ w_g (D_g − d̲) / Σ w_g).

Under `survey=SurveyDesign(weights, strata, psu, fpc)`, the variance composes via Binder (1983) Taylor-series linearization — the per-unit influence function of μ̂ is aggregated by PSU within strata with FPC correction, using the shared `compute_survey_if_variance` helper (`diff_diff/survey.py:1802`) consumed by dCDH / EfficientDiD / CallawaySantAnna. Survey design columns (strata / PSU / FPC) are required to be constant within unit (sampling-unit assignment convention); within-unit variance raises `ValueError` front-door per `feedback_no_silent_failures`.

- **Note (parity gap):** no public weighted-CCF bias-corrected local-linear reference exists in any language. `nprobust::lprobust` has no weight argument; Calonico-Cattaneo-Farrell's companion `rdrobust` is RD-shaped (not HAD-shaped); `np::npreg`'s local-linear algorithm does not reduce to a straightforward weighted-OLS at the intercept. The Phase 1c `atol=1e-12` R bit-parity bar is therefore NOT reachable on the weighted bias-corrected CI. Methodology confidence under informative weights comes from the stack documented below.
- **Note:** Uniform-weights bit-parity — `lprobust(..., weights=np.ones(N))` ≡ unweighted at `atol=1e-14, rtol=1e-14` across the full output struct (`tau_cl`, `tau_bc`, `se_cl`, `se_rb`, `V_Y_cl`, `V_Y_bc`). Regression tests in `tests/test_nprobust_port.py::TestWeightedLprobust` and `tests/test_bias_corrected_lprobust.py::TestWeightedBiasCorrectedLocalLinear`.
- **Note:** Cross-language weighted-OLS parity — `benchmarks/R/generate_np_npreg_weighted_golden.R` produces a manually-implemented-R weighted-OLS reference against which Python recovers the intercept + slope at `atol=1e-12` on 4 DGPs (`tests/test_np_npreg_weighted_parity.py`). This is a regression lock on the kernel + weighted-OLS formula, not third-party validation of the CCF bias correction.
- **Note:** Monte Carlo oracle consistency — `tests/test_had_mc.py` validates that the weighted estimator recovers the oracle τ under informative sampling, with coverage near nominal and visible bias reduction vs unweighted. Slow-gated; 4 tests.
- **Note:** Auto-bandwidth selection (Phase 1b MSE-DPI via `lpbwselect_mse_dpi`) remains UNWEIGHTED in this phase; users who want a weight-aware bandwidth should pass `h`/`b` explicitly. The auto path with uniform weights reduces to the existing unweighted bandwidth selector, so the uniform-weights bit-parity chain is preserved.
- **Note:** Replicate-weight SurveyDesigns (BRR / Fay / JK1 / JKn / SDR) on the HAD continuous path raise `NotImplementedError` in this PR; Rao-Wu-style rescaled bootstrap is deferred to Phase 4.5 C (survey-under-pretests).
- **Note:** `HeterogeneousAdoptionDiD.fit()` dispatch matrix after Phase 4.5 B + 4.5 C — survey/weights are supported on ALL design × aggregate combinations (continuous × {overall, event-study}, mass-point × {overall, event-study}). The HAD pretests (`qug_test`, `stute_test`, `yatchew_hr_test`, joint Stute variants, `did_had_pretest_workflow`) ship survey support in Phase 4.5 C (PR #370) — `qug_test` permanently rejects (Phase 4.5 C0 deferral; see "QUG Null Test" §); the linearity family supports pweight + PSU + FPC via PSU-level Mammen multipliers (Stute) + closed-form weighted variance components (Yatchew); replicate-weight and stratified designs raise `NotImplementedError` (parallel follow-ups). The canonical kwarg on all 8 HAD surfaces is `survey_design=` (see "Note (HAD survey-design API consolidation)" below); `survey=` / `weights=` remain accepted as deprecated aliases for one minor cycle.
- **Note (HAD survey-design API consolidation):** All 8 HAD surfaces — `HeterogeneousAdoptionDiD.fit`, `did_had_pretest_workflow`, `qug_test`, `stute_test`, `yatchew_hr_test`, `stute_joint_pretest`, `joint_pretrends_test`, `joint_homogeneity_test` — accept the canonical kwarg `survey_design=` (matching `ContinuousDiD`, `EfficientDiD`, `ChaisemartinDHaultfoeuille`). The pre-existing dual `survey=` and `weights=` kwargs become deprecated aliases (`DeprecationWarning`); both will be removed in the next minor release. Internal back-end behavior is UNCHANGED (the legacy paths for `weights=np.ndarray` and `survey=SurveyDesign(...)` still execute the same code; only the entry signature wraps them). Mutex semantics extend from 2-way (`survey + weights`) to 3-way (`survey_design + survey + weights`) — at most one may be non-None per call. Distinct mutex error messages by surface group: data-in surfaces (HAD.fit + workflow + joint data-in wrappers) point users to `survey_design=SurveyDesign(weights='col_name', ...)`; the three array-in linearity helpers (`stute_test` / `yatchew_hr_test` / `stute_joint_pretest`) point to `survey_design=make_pweight_design(arr)` (for pweight-only) or `survey_design=<pre-resolved ResolvedSurveyDesign>` (for full PSU/strata/FPC). The 8th surface — `qug_test` — has its own qug-specific mutex message that does NOT advertise `make_pweight_design(arr)` as a migration target; QUG-under-survey is permanently rejected (Phase 4.5 C0 deferral, see "QUG Null Test" §) regardless of which kwarg variant the caller uses, so the migration path doesn't apply. Array-in helpers reject `survey_design=SurveyDesign(...)` with `TypeError` since they have no `data` to resolve column names against. The `make_pweight_design(weights: np.ndarray) -> ResolvedSurveyDesign` factory is exported from the `diff_diff` top level (formerly `survey._make_trivial_resolved`, kept as a permanent private alias for back-compat); `weights` must be 1-D (scalar / 0-D / column-vector inputs raise `ValueError` at the front door).

*Weighted 2SLS (Phase 4.5 B):* `_fit_mass_point_2sls(..., weights=, return_influence=)` extends the Wald-IV / 2SLS sandwich with pweight semantics:
- **Weighted bread**: `Z'WX = Z'·diag(w)·X` (`w¹`, matches `estimatr::iv_robust(..., weights=)` weighted-bread convention).
- **HC1 pweight meat**: `Ω_HC1 = (n/(n-k)) · Z'·diag(w² u²)·Z` (`w²` squared, Wooldridge 2010 Eq. 12.37; matches `linalg.py:1141` pweight convention). Bit-exact with `estimatr::iv_robust(..., weights=, se_type="HC1")` at `atol=1e-10`.
- **CR1 pweight-cluster meat**: for each cluster c, `s_c = Z'_c·(w·u)_c`; `Ω_CR1 = (G/(G-1))·((n-1)/(n-k))·Σ_c s_c s_c'` (`w¹` inside cluster score). Bit-exact with `estimatr::iv_robust(..., weights=, clusters=, se_type="stata")` at `atol=1e-10`.
- **Classical**: sandwich form `Ω_cl = σ²·Z'·diag(w²)·Z` with `σ² = Σw²u²/(Σw-k)`. Deviates from `estimatr` classical (projection-form + `n-k` DOF) by `O(1/n)` at non-uniform weights; unweighted path is bit-exact by equivalence. Skipped in cross-language parity tests.
- **Per-unit IF on β̂-scale** (for Binder-TSL survey composition): `psi_g = [(Z'WX)^{-1} · z_g · w_g · u_g][1] · sqrt((n-1)/(n-k))`. The scaling factor absorbs DOF / small-sample differences so `compute_survey_if_variance(psi, trivial_resolved) ≈ V_HC1[1,1]` at `atol=1e-10` (mirrors PR #359 convention; asserted by `TestIFScaleInvariant` and bit-exact against estimatr HC1 on 4 DGPs). Fixture: `benchmarks/R/generate_estimatr_iv_robust_golden.R` → `benchmarks/data/estimatr_iv_robust_golden.json`.

*Event-study survey composition (Phase 4.5 B):* The per-horizon loop in `_fit_event_study` threads `weights_unit_full` + `resolved_survey_unit_full` through to both `_fit_continuous` and `_fit_mass_point_2sls` (the latter with `return_influence=True` under weighted fits). The returned IF matrix `Psi ∈ R^{G × H}` has a shared construction contract across paths — each column on the β̂-scale, such that `compute_survey_if_variance(Psi[:, e], resolved) ≈ V_β[e]`. Per-horizon analytical variance uses Binder-TSL via `compute_survey_if_variance` (survey= path) or the weighted-robust HC1 sandwich (weights= shortcut). `survey_metadata`, `variance_formula` (`"survey_binder_tsl"` / `"survey_binder_tsl_2sls"` / `"pweight"` / `"pweight_2sls"`), and `effective_dose_mean` populate identically to the static path. Pre-PR numerical output is preserved bit-exactly on the unweighted path when `cband=False` (stability invariant; Phase 2b convention unchanged for unweighted fits).

*Sup-t multiplier bootstrap (Phase 4.5 B):* Simultaneous confidence band on the weighted event-study path via `_sup_t_multiplier_bootstrap`:

1. **Multiplier draws**: reuse `diff_diff.bootstrap_utils.generate_survey_multiplier_weights_batch` (survey= path: PSU-level draws with stratum centering, FPC scaling, lonely-PSU handling) or `generate_bootstrap_weights_batch` (weights= shortcut: unit-level Rademacher). Default `n_bootstrap=999` (CS parity); `seed` exposed on `HeterogeneousAdoptionDiD.__init__` for reproducibility.
2. **Perturbations**: `delta = xi @ Psi` — shape `(B, H)` matrix-matrix product, NO `(1/n)` prefactor (matches `staggered_bootstrap.py:373` idiom; `Psi` is already on the β̂-scale).
3. **t-statistics**: `t[b, e] = delta[b, e] / se[e]` where `se[e]` is the per-horizon analytical Binder-TSL / HC1 SE from the loop above.
4. **Sup-t distribution**: `sup_t[b] = max_e |t[b, e]|` with finite-mask filtering of degenerate horizons.
5. **Critical value**: `q = quantile(sup_t[finite], 1 - alpha)`. Simultaneous band: `cband_low[e] = att[e] - q · se[e]`.

**Reduction invariant**: at `H=1`, the sup collapses to the marginal and `q → Φ⁻¹(1 - alpha/2) ≈ 1.96` at `alpha=0.05` up to MC noise. Locked by `TestSupTReducesToNormalAtH1` (G=500, B=5000, seed=42, `atol=0.15` on the quantile) and `TestEventStudySurveyCband::test_trivial_survey_h1_sup_t_matches_analytical` / `test_stratified_h1_sup_t_matches_analytical` for the trivial-survey and stratified cases respectively.

**Scope**: sup-t bootstrap runs only when `aggregate="event_study"` AND `weights=` or `survey=` is supplied AND `cband=True` (default). Unweighted event-study skips the bootstrap entirely — pre-Phase 4.5 B numerical output bit-exactly preserved. Setting `cband=False` on the weighted path disables the bootstrap (useful for smoke-test bit-parity assertions against the unweighted path at uniform weights).

**`weights=` shortcut ↔ bootstrap routing**: on the `weights=` shortcut (no user-supplied `SurveyDesign`), per-horizon SE stays analytical (CCT-2014 robust for continuous, HC1/classical/CR1 sandwich for mass-point — NOT Binder-TSL), but sup-t calibration is routed through a synthetic trivial `ResolvedSurveyDesign` (pweight, no strata / PSU / FPC, `lonely_psu="remove"`) so the centered + sqrt(n/(n-1))-corrected bootstrap branch fires uniformly. This matches the analytical HC1 variance family — the `compute_survey_if_variance(IF, trivial) ≈ V_HC1` invariant from the IF scale convention — so the bootstrap variance target agrees with the per-horizon SE normalizer. Without this routing, the unit-level bootstrap branch would normalize against raw `sum(ψ²) = ((n-1)/n) · V_HC1` on the HC1-scaled IF and produce silently too-narrow simultaneous bands. Regression-locked by the `weights=`-shortcut / `survey=`-trivial equivalence test in `TestEventStudySurveyCband`.

- **Deviation from shared survey-bootstrap contract:** `_sup_t_multiplier_bootstrap` raises `NotImplementedError` on `SurveyDesign(lonely_psu="adjust")` with singleton strata. The shared `generate_survey_multiplier_weights_batch` helper pools singleton PSUs into a pseudo-stratum with NONZERO multipliers, but `compute_survey_if_variance` centers singleton PSU scores at the GLOBAL mean of PSU scores (rather than the pseudo-stratum mean). Matching the two would require a pooled-singleton pseudo-stratum centering transform in the HAD sup-t path that has not been derived. The HAD-specific limitation is scoped to: weighted event-study + `cband=True` + `lonely_psu="adjust"` + at least one singleton stratum. Practitioners can use `lonely_psu="remove"` or `"certainty"` (matches the analytical target bit-exactly on the HAD sup-t path), or pass `cband=False` to skip the simultaneous band. All other survey-bootstrap consumers (CallawaySantAnna, dCDH, SDID) retain full `lonely_psu="adjust"` support through the shared helper.

- **Deviation: weighted mass-point `vcov_type="classical"` on survey/sup-t paths:** `vcov_type="classical"` raises `NotImplementedError` whenever the mass-point IF matrix is consumed downstream — specifically on `design="mass_point"` + `survey=` (static + event-study) and `design="mass_point"` + `weights=` + `aggregate="event_study"` + `cband=True`. The per-unit 2SLS IF returned by `_fit_mass_point_2sls` is scaled (`sqrt((n-1)/(n-k))`) to match V_HC1 via `compute_survey_if_variance`; mixing it with a classical analytical SE would silently return a V_HC1-targeted variance under a classical label. A classical-aligned IF derivation is queued for a follow-up PR. The allowed weighted-mass-point combinations are: `vcov_type="hc1"` on every path; `vcov_type="classical"` on `weights=` + `aggregate="overall"`, and `weights=` + `aggregate="event_study"` + `cband=False` (no IF consumption).

- **Deviation: mass-point `cluster=` + `survey=` rejected:** the `survey=` path composes Binder-TSL variance via `compute_survey_if_variance`, which would silently overwrite the CR1 cluster-robust sandwich while result metadata still reports `vcov_type="cr1"`. Narrowed (R4) to apply only to: `design="mass_point"` + `survey=` + `cluster=` (static and event-study), and `design="mass_point"` + `weights=` + `cluster=` + `aggregate="event_study"` + `cband=True` (where the sup-t bootstrap normalizes HC1-scale perturbations by the CR1 analytical SE). The `weights=` shortcut + `cluster=` on `aggregate="overall"` or `aggregate="event_study"` with `cband=False` continues to work — returns the weighted-CR1 pweight sandwich bit-exact with `estimatr::iv_robust(..., weights=, clusters=, se_type="stata")`.

- 2SLS (Design 1 mass-point case): standard 2SLS inference (details not elaborated in the paper).
- TWFE with small `G`: HC2 standard errors with Bell-McCaffrey (2002) degrees-of-freedom correction, following Imbens and Kolesar (2016). Used in the Pierce and Schott (2016) application with `G=103`. Added library-wide to `diff_diff/linalg.py` as a new `vcov_type` dispatch (Phase 1a), exposed on `DifferenceInDifferences` and `TwoWayFixedEffects`.
- Bootstrap: wild bootstrap with Mammen (1993) two-point weights is used for the Stute test (see Diagnostics below), NOT for the main WAS estimator. Reuses the existing `diff_diff.bootstrap_utils.generate_bootstrap_weights(..., weight_type="mammen")` helper.
- Clustering: no explicit clustering formulas in the paper's core equations.

*Convergence rates:*
- Design 1' nonparametric estimator: `G^{2/5}` (univariate nonparametric rate; Equations 5-6).
- Design 1 discrete-mass-point case: `√G` (parametric rate).
- Estimate of `d̲` via `min_g D_{g,2}`: rate `G` (asymptotically negligible).

*Asymptotic distributions (Equations 5-6):*
- Equation 5: `√(G h_G) (β̂_{h_G}^{np} - WAS - h_G² · C m''(0) / (2 E[D_2])) →^d N(0, σ²(0) ∫_0^∞ k*(u)² du / (E[D_2]² f_{D_2}(0)))`
- Equation 6 (optimal rate, `G^{1/5} h_G → c > 0`): `G^{2/5} (β̂_{h_G}^{np} - WAS) →^d N(c² C m''(0) / (2 E[D_2]), σ²(0) ∫_0^∞ k*(u)² du / (c E[D_2]² f_{D_2}(0)))`
- Kernel constants: `κ_k := ∫_0^∞ t^k k(t) dt`, `k*(t) := (κ_2 - κ_1 t) / (κ_0 κ_2 - κ_1²) · k(t)`, `C := (κ_2² - κ_1 κ_3) / (κ_0 κ_2 - κ_1²)`.

*Edge cases:*
- **No genuinely untreated units, D_2 continuous with `d̲ = 0` (Design 1')**: use `β̂_{h*_G}^{np}` (Equation 7) with bias-corrected CI (Equation 8).
- **No untreated units, `d̲ > 0`, `D_2` has mass point at `d̲`**: use 2SLS of `ΔY` on `D_2` with instrument `1{D_2 > d̲}`, or equivalent sample-average formula. Identifies WAS_{d̲} under Assumption 6 (Theorem 3) or the sign of WAS under Assumption 5 (Theorem 2).
- **No untreated units, `d̲ > 0`, `D_2` continuous near `d̲`**: replace 0 by `d̲` and `D_2` by `D_2 - d̲` in Equation 7; estimate `d̲` by `min_g D_{g,2}`.
- **Genuinely untreated units present but a small share**: Authors do NOT require untreated units to be dropped. In the Garrett et al. (2020) bonus-depreciation application with 12 untreated counties out of 2,954, they keep the untreated subsample. Simulations (DGP 2, DGP 3) suggest CIs retain close-to-nominal coverage even when `f_{D_2}(0) = 0`.
- **WAS is not point-identified without a QUG (Proposition 1, proof C.1)**: the proof explicitly constructs `tilde-Y_2(d) := Y_2(d) + (c / d̲) · E[D_2] · (d - d̲)` for any `c ∈ R`, compatible with the data under Assumptions 2 and 3 but with `tilde-WAS = WAS + c`. Practical consequence: do NOT report a point estimate of WAS under Design 1 without Assumption 5 or 6; fall back to Theorem 2 (sign) or Theorem 3 (WAS_{d̲}).
- **Extensive-margin effects**: ruled out by Assumption 3. If a jump `Y_2(0) ≠ Y_2(0+)` is suspected, the target parameter and estimator are not appropriate.
- **Partial identification of WAS_{d̲}**: only identified up to a positive constant offset `≤ ε` by the bound in Equation 22 (Jensen inequality argument in Appendix C.3).
- **Density at boundary**: Assumption 4 requires `f_{D_2}(0) > 0`. This is a non-trivial assumption since 0 is on the boundary of `Supp(D_2)`.
- **Variation in treatment timing**: Appendix B.2 - "in designs with variation in treatment timing, there must be an untreated group, at least till the period where the last cohort gets treated." In Phase 2b (`aggregate="event_study"`) the implementation auto-filters to the last-treatment cohort plus never-treated units with a `UserWarning` when `first_treat_col` is supplied (see Phase 2b last-cohort filter note below); when `first_treat_col` is omitted the estimator detects multiple first-positive-dose cohorts from the dose path and raises a front-door `ValueError` directing users to pass `first_treat_col` or use `ChaisemartinDHaultfoeuille`.
- **Mechanical zero at reference period under linear trends (Footnote 13, main text p. 31)**: with industry/unit-specific linear trends, the pre-trends estimator is mechanically zero in the second-to-last pre-period (the slope anchor year). Practical consequence: that year is not an informative placebo check.

*Algorithm (Design 1' nonparametric - summarized from Section 3.1.3-3.1.4 and Equations 7-8):*
1. Compute bandwidth `ĥ*_G` via Calonico et al. (2018) plug-in MSE-optimal bandwidth selector on the local-linear regression of `ΔY_g` on `D_{g,2}` with kernel weights `k(D_{g,2}/h)/h`.
2. Fit the local-linear regression at bandwidth `ĥ*_G`; read off the intercept `μ̂_{ĥ*_G}`.
3. Compute `β̂_{ĥ*_G}^{np} = ((1/G) Σ ΔY_g - μ̂_{ĥ*_G}) / ((1/G) Σ D_{g,2})` (Equation 7).
4. Compute the first-order bias estimator `M̂_{ĥ*_G}` and the variance estimator `V̂_{ĥ*_G}` (Calonico et al. 2018, 2019).
5. Form the bias-corrected 95% CI by Equation 8.

*Algorithm variant - Design 1 mass-point 2SLS (Section 3.2.4):*
1. Detect a mass point at `d̲`: either user-supplied `d̲` or detected automatically via the `design="auto"` rule (fraction of observations at `min_g D_{g,2}` exceeds 2%).
2. Either compute `(Ȳ_{D_2 > d̲} - Ȳ_{D_2 = d̲}) / (D̄_{D_2 > d̲} - D̄_{D_2 = d̲})` (sample averages), or run 2SLS of `ΔY_g` on `D_{g,2}` with instrument `1{D_{g,2} > d̲}`.
3. Report the estimate as WAS_{d̲} under Assumption 6 or as the sign-identifying quantity under Assumption 5.

*Algorithm variant - QUG null test (Theorem 4, Section 3.3):*
Tuning-parameter-free test of `H_0: d̲ = 0` versus `H_1: d̲ > 0`. Shipped in `diff_diff/had_pretests.py` as `qug_test()`.
1. Sort `D_{2,g}` ascending to obtain order statistics `D_{2,(1)} ≤ D_{2,(2)} ≤ ... ≤ D_{2,(G)}`.
2. Compute test statistic `T := D_{2,(1)} / (D_{2,(2)} - D_{2,(1)})`.
3. Reject `H_0` if `T > 1/α - 1`.
4. Theorem 4 establishes: asymptotic size `α`; uniform consistency against fixed alternatives; local power at rate `G` on the class `F^{d̲,d̄}_{m,K}` of differentiable cdfs with positive density and Lipschitz derivative.
5. Li et al. (2024, Theorem 2.4) implies the QUG test is asymptotically independent of the WAS / TWFE estimator, so conditional inference on WAS given non-rejection does not distort inference (asymptotically; the paper's Footnote 8 notes the extension to triangular arrays is conjectured but not proven).
- **Note:** Implementation is `O(G)` via `np.partition`; no sort required.
- **Note (Phase 4.5 C0):** `qug_test(..., survey=...)` and `qug_test(..., weights=...)` raise `NotImplementedError` **permanently** (Phase 4.5 C0 decision gate, 2026-04 -- direct-helper gate is permanent). The Phase 4.5 C0 release also gated `did_had_pretest_workflow(..., survey=...)` / `weights=` with `NotImplementedError`, but that workflow gate was **temporary**: Phase 4.5 C (PR #370, 2026-04) replaces it with functional dispatch that skips the QUG step with `UserWarning` and runs the linearity family with the survey-aware mechanism (see Note (Phase 4.5 C) below for the full algorithm). Direct callers of `qug_test` still get the permanent rejection. Three reasons QUG-under-survey is genuinely hard, not "we just haven't done the lit review":
  1. **Extreme order statistics are not smooth functionals of the empirical CDF.** Standard survey machinery (Binder-TSL linearization via `compute_survey_if_variance`, Rao-Wu rescaled bootstrap via `bootstrap_utils.generate_rao_wu_weights`, Krieger-Pfeffermann (1997) EDF tests for complex surveys) all rely on Hadamard differentiability of the test statistic in the empirical CDF. The first two order statistics are NOT differentiable functionals — small perturbations to F near zero produce O(1) shifts in `D_{(1)}`. None of the standard survey-bootstrap or linearization tools give a calibrated test for QUG.
  2. **The `Exp(1)/Exp(1)` limit law assumes iid sampling with smooth density at zero.** Under cluster sampling, `D_{(1)}` and `D_{(2)}` may both come from the same PSU, breaking the independence required for the Poisson-process limit of rescaled spacings near the boundary. Under stratification, the smallest dose may come from a small stratum that's systematically over- or under-sampled, biasing the test.
  3. **The literature on EVT under unequal-probability sampling is sparse.** Quintos et al. (2001) and Beirlant et al. cover tail-INDEX estimation under unequal sample sizes. There is no off-the-shelf method for "test the support endpoint under complex sampling" in the standard survey-statistics toolkit. Adapting Hill / Pickands / DEdH estimators to the boundary problem would be novel research, not engineering. The de Chaisemartin et al. (2026) paper itself does not discuss survey extensions of QUG.
  The survey-compatible alternative for HAD pretesting is **joint Stute** (a CvM cusum of regression residuals) — a smooth functional of the empirical CDF for which Krieger-Pfeffermann (1997) + a survey-aware multiplier bootstrap give a calibrated test. Phase 4.5 C (PR #370) ships survey support for the linearity family — the **PSU-level Mammen multiplier bootstrap** for `stute_test` and the joint variants (NOT Rao-Wu rescaling — multiplier bootstrap is a different mechanism), and **closed-form weighted OLS + pweight-sandwich variance components** for `yatchew_hr_test`. See the dedicated Note (Phase 4.5 C) below for the full algorithm.
  **Research direction (out of scope for diff-diff):** the bridge IS sketchable by combining (a) endpoint-estimation EVT under iid (Hall 1982, Aarssen-de Haan 1994, Hall-Wang 1999, Beirlant-de Wet-Goegebeur 2006); (b) survey-aware functional CLT for the empirical process (Boistard-Lopuhaä-Ruiz-Gazen 2017, Bertail-Chautru-Clémençon 2017); and (c) tail-empirical-process theory (Drees 2003) to define a "design-effective boundary intensity" `λ_eff = Σ_h W_h · f_h(0+)`. Under a "no boundary clumping" assumption (`P(D_{(1)}, D_{(2)}` in same PSU `| both ≤ δ) → 0`), the `Exp(1)/Exp(1)` limit law's pivotality is preserved and only the calibration needs a survey-aware bootstrap (subsampling within strata per Politis-Romano-Wolf, or Bertail et al.'s design-aware bootstrap). This is publishable methodology research — one paper, ~6-12 months for a methods PhD student. If the bridge gets built and published externally, this gate can be revisited.
- **Note (Phase 4.5 C):** `stute_test`, `yatchew_hr_test`, `stute_joint_pretest`, `joint_pretrends_test`, `joint_homogeneity_test`, and `did_had_pretest_workflow` accept `survey_design=` (canonical) plus the deprecated aliases `survey=` and `weights=` (DeprecationWarning, removal next minor — see "Note (HAD survey-design API consolidation)" below). On data-in surfaces (`did_had_pretest_workflow`, `joint_pretrends_test`, `joint_homogeneity_test`), `survey_design=` accepts a `SurveyDesign` (resolved against `data` at fit time). On array-in surfaces (`stute_test`, `yatchew_hr_test`, `stute_joint_pretest`), `survey_design=` accepts a pre-resolved `ResolvedSurveyDesign`; for the pweight-only convenience, construct via `survey_design=make_pweight_design(arr)` (`make_pweight_design` exported from the `diff_diff` top level). Mechanism varies by test:
  - **Stute family** (`stute_test`, `stute_joint_pretest`, joint wrappers) uses **PSU-level Mammen multiplier bootstrap** via `bootstrap_utils.generate_survey_multiplier_weights_batch` (the same kernel as PR #363's HAD event-study sup-t bootstrap). Each replicate draws an `(n_bootstrap, n_psu)` Mammen multiplier matrix; multipliers broadcast to per-obs perturbation `eta_obs[g] = eta_psu[psu(g)]`. The bootstrap residual perturbation is `dy_b = fitted + eps * eta_obs` (paper Appendix D wild-bootstrap form — multipliers attach to UNWEIGHTED residuals; the weighting flows through the OLS refit + the weighted CvM, NOT through the perturbation step). Followed by weighted OLS refit (`_fit_weighted_ols_intercept_slope`) and weighted CvM recompute via `_cvm_statistic_weighted`. Joint Stute SHARES the multiplier matrix across horizons within each replicate, preserving both the vector-valued empirical-process unit-level dependence (Delgado 1993; Escanciano 2006) AND PSU clustering (Krieger-Pfeffermann 1997). PSU-shared multipliers are conservative under no-within-PSU outcome correlation (over-clustering gives conservative size in finite samples), asymptotically correct under the standard survey assumption that PSU is the ultimate sampling unit AND outcomes correlate within PSU. The pweight-only entry (`survey_design=make_pweight_design(arr)`, or the deprecated `weights=arr` alias) routes through a synthetic trivial `ResolvedSurveyDesign` (constructed via `make_pweight_design`, the public alias for the formerly private `survey._make_trivial_resolved`) so the kernel is shared across both entry paths. NOT "Rao-Wu rescaled bootstrap" — different mechanism (the Rao-Wu kernel rescales per-unit weights via stratified PSU resampling, while this kernel applies multipliers without resampling).
  - **Yatchew** (`yatchew_hr_test`) uses **closed-form weighted OLS + pweight-sandwich variance components** (no bootstrap). All three components reduce bit-exactly to the unweighted formulas at `w=ones(G)` (locked at `atol=1e-14` in `TestYatchewHRTestSurvey::test_weighted_reduces_to_unweighted_at_uniform_weights`):
    - `sigma2_lin = sum(w * eps^2) / sum(w)` (weighted OLS residual variance).
    - `sigma2_diff = sum(w_avg * (dy_g - dy_{g-1})^2) / (2 * sum(w))` with arithmetic-mean pair weights `w_avg_g = (w_g + w_{g-1})/2`. Divisor uses `sum(w)` (=G at `w=1`), NOT `sum(w_avg)`, to match the existing `(1/(2G))` unweighted formula at `had_pretests.py:1635`.
    - `sigma4_W = sum(w_avg * eps_g^2 * eps_{g-1}^2) / sum(w_avg)` reduces to `(1/(G-1)) * sum(prod)` at `w=1`.
    - `T_hr = sqrt(sum(w)) * (sigma2_lin - sigma2_diff) / sigma2_W` (effective-sample-size convention; reduces to `sqrt(G)` at `w=1`).
    Strictly positive weights required (the adjacent-difference variance is undefined under contiguous-zero blocks). PSU clustering is NOT propagated through the variance-ratio statistic (would require a survey-aware variance-of-variance estimator, out of scope). Pair-weight convention follows Krieger-Pfeffermann (1997, §3) for design-consistent inference on smooth functionals.
  - **Workflow** (`did_had_pretest_workflow`) under `survey=` / `weights=`: skips the QUG step with a `UserWarning` (per Phase 4.5 C0 deferral), sets `qug=None` on the report, and dispatches the linearity family with the survey-aware mechanism. Verdict carries a `"linearity-conditional verdict; QUG-under-survey deferred per Phase 4.5 C0"` suffix. `all_pass` drops the QUG-conclusiveness condition; the linearity-conditional rule splits by aggregate:
    - `aggregate="overall"`: `True` iff at least one of `stute`/`yatchew` is conclusive AND no conclusive test rejects (paper Section 4 step-3 "Stute OR Yatchew" wording carries through).
    - `aggregate="event_study"`: `True` iff `pretrends_joint` is non-None and conclusive, `homogeneity_joint` is conclusive, AND neither rejects. Both joint variants must be conclusive on the event-study path (same step-2 + step-3 closure as the unweighted aggregate, just without the QUG step).
  - **Replicate-weight survey designs (BRR/Fay/JK1/JKn/SDR) deferred** to a parallel follow-up. Each helper raises `NotImplementedError` on `survey.replicate_weights is not None` (defense in depth: workflow + every direct-helper entry rejects, mirroring the reciprocal-guard discipline from PR #346). The per-replicate weight-ratio rescaling for the OLS-on-residuals refit step is not covered by the multiplier-bootstrap composition above.
  - **`lonely_psu='adjust'` with singleton strata is rejected** with `NotImplementedError` on the Stute family (mirrors HAD sup-t bootstrap at `had.py:2081-2118`). The bootstrap multiplier helper pools singleton strata into a pseudo-stratum with nonzero multipliers, but the analytical variance target requires a pseudo-stratum centering transform that has not been derived for the Stute CvM. Use `lonely_psu='remove'` (drops singleton contributions) or `'certainty'` (zero-variance singletons); both produce all-zero singleton multipliers that match a well-defined analytical target. Variance-unidentified designs (`df_survey <= 0` after the adjust+singleton case is handled) return `NaN` with a `UserWarning` (single-PSU unstratified or one-PSU-per-stratum under remove/certainty).
  - **Stratified designs (`SurveyDesign(strata=...)`) are rejected** with `NotImplementedError` on `stute_test` and `stute_joint_pretest` (and propagate to `did_had_pretest_workflow`). The HAD sup-t bootstrap (had.py:2120+) applies a within-stratum demean + `sqrt(n_h/(n_h-1))` small-sample correction AFTER `generate_survey_multiplier_weights_batch` to make the bootstrap variance match the Binder-TSL stratified target. That same correction has NOT been derived for the Stute CvM functional, so applying the helper's raw multipliers directly to residual perturbations on stratified designs would leave the bootstrap p-value silently miscalibrated. Phase 4.5 C narrows Stute-family survey support to **pweight-only** (no strata, no PSU), **PSU-only** (`SurveyDesign(weights=, psu=)`), and **FPC-only** (`SurveyDesign(weights=, fpc=)`) designs. Stratified designs are a follow-up after the matching Stute-CvM stratified-correction derivation lands.
  - **Constant-within-unit invariant**: per-row `weights=` / `survey=col` are aggregated to per-unit `(G,)` arrays via the existing HAD helpers `_aggregate_unit_weights` / `_aggregate_unit_resolved_survey` (had.py:1604, :1671); these enforce constant-within-unit invariant on weights and on every survey design column (strata, psu, fpc) and raise on violation. Direct callers passing already-resolved `ResolvedSurveyDesign` (or per-unit `weights` array) bypass this aggregation; the invariant is the caller's responsibility on that path.
  - **Distributional parity, NOT bit-exact**: at `weights=ones(G)` the survey path produces a different bootstrap p-value than the unweighted path because RNG consumption differs (batched `generate_survey_multiplier_weights_batch` vs per-iteration `_generate_mammen_weights`). The two paths agree DISTRIBUTIONALLY at large B (`|p_avg_diff| < 0.03` over 100 reps at `B=5000`); they DO NOT agree numerically at `atol=1e-10`. The unweighted code path is preserved bit-exactly (stability invariant; the new `weights=`/`survey=` arms are separate `if` branches).

*Algorithm variant - TWFE linearity test via Stute (1997) Cramér-von Mises with wild bootstrap (Section 4.3, Appendix D):*
Shipped in `diff_diff/had_pretests.py` as `stute_test()`. Tests whether `E(ΔY | D_2)` is linear, the testable implication of TWFE's homogeneity assumption (Assumption 8) in HADs.
1. Fit linear regression of `ΔY_g` on constant and `D_{g,2}`; collect residuals `ε̂_{lin,g}`.
2. Form cusum process `c_G(d) := G^{-1/2} Σ_{g=1}^G 1{D_{g,2} ≤ d} · ε̂_{lin,g}`.
3. Compute Cramér-von Mises statistic `S := (1/G) Σ_{g=1}^G c_G²(D_{g,2})`. Equivalently, after sorting by `D_{g,2}`: `S = Σ_{g=1}^G (g/G)² · ((1/g) Σ_{h=1}^g ε̂_{lin,(h)})²`.
4. Wild bootstrap for p-value (Stute, Manteiga, Quindimil 1998; Algorithm in main text p. 25 and vectorized form in Appendix D):
   - Draw `(η_g)_{g=1,...,G}` i.i.d. from the Mammen two-point distribution: `η_g = (1+√5)/2` with probability `(√5-1)/(2√5)`, else `η_g = (1-√5)/2`. Reuses `diff_diff.bootstrap_utils.generate_bootstrap_weights(..., "mammen")`.
   - Set `ε̂*_{lin,g} := ε̂_{lin,g} · η_g`.
   - Compute `ΔY*_g = β̂_0 + D_{g,2} · β̂_{fe} + ε̂*_{lin,g}` (paper writes `ΔD_g` here, which equals `D_{g,2}` since `D_{g,1} = 0`; the two forms are equivalent in this design).
   - Re-fit OLS on the bootstrap sample to get `ε̂*_{lin,g}`, compute `S*`.
   - Repeat B times; the p-value is the fraction of `S*` exceeding `S`.
5. Properties (page 26): asymptotic size, consistency under any fixed alternative, non-trivial local power at rate `G^{-1/2}`.
6. Vectorized implementation (Appendix D): with `L` a `G × G` lower-triangular matrix of ones, `S = (1/G²) · 1ᵀ (L · E)^{∘2}`. Bootstrap uses a `G × G` realization matrix `H` of Mammen weights; memory-bounded at `G ≈ 100,000`.
- **Note:** Default `n_bootstrap = 999` is a diff-diff choice; the paper does not prescribe. A front-door `ValueError` is raised for `n_bootstrap < 99` (below which the discretised bootstrap p-value grid `1/(B+1)` is too coarse to be meaningful).

*Algorithm variant - Yatchew (1997) heteroskedasticity-robust specification test (Appendix E, Theorem 7):*
Shipped in `diff_diff/had_pretests.py` as `yatchew_hr_test()`. Alternative to Stute when `G` is large or heteroskedasticity is suspected. Two nulls supported via the keyword-only `null=` argument: `"linearity"` (default; paper Theorem 7) and `"mean_independence"` (R-parity extension, see Note below).
1. Sort `(D_{g,2}, ΔY_g)` by `D_{g,2}`.
2. Compute difference-based variance estimator: `σ̂²_{diff} := (1/(2G)) Σ_{g=2}^G [(Y_{2,(g)} - Y_{1,(g)}) - (Y_{2,(g-1)} - Y_{1,(g-1)})]²`.
3. Fit OLS; compute residual variance `σ̂²_{lin}`. Under `null="linearity"` (default): residuals from `dy ~ 1 + d` (paper Theorem 7). Under `null="mean_independence"`: residuals from intercept-only `dy ~ 1`, i.e. `eps = dy - mean(dy)` (R-parity extension).
4. Heteroskedasticity-robust variance: `σ̂⁴_W := (1/(G-1)) Σ_{g=2}^G ε̂²_{lin,(g)} ε̂²_{lin,(g-1)}`.
5. Robust test statistic: `T_{hr} := √G · (σ̂²_{lin} - σ̂²_{diff}) / σ̂²_W`. Under `null="linearity"`, reject linearity if `T_{hr} ≥ q_{1-α}` (Equation 29 and downstream in Theorem 7). Under `null="mean_independence"`, the same statistic and critical value reject the mean-independence null `H_0: E[dY|D] = E[dY]` — only the residual definition (and therefore `σ̂²_lin`) differs between modes; the `σ̂²_diff`, `σ̂⁴_W`, and sort-by-`d` machinery are shared.
6. Theorem 7: under `H_0`, `lim E[φ_α] = α`; under fixed alternative, `lim E[φ_α] = 1`; local power against alternatives at rate `G^{-1/4}` (slower than Stute's `G^{-1/2}` rate, but scales to `G ≥ 10⁵`).
7. Inference on `β̂_{fe}` conditional on accepting the linearity test is asymptotically valid (Theorem 7, Point 1; citing de Chaisemartin and D'Haultfœuille 2024 arXiv:2407.03725).
- **Note (mean-independence null is the R-parity extension, not paper-derived):** The paper (Appendix E, Theorem 7) defines `yatchew_hr_test` only under the linearity null. The `null="mean_independence"` mode mirrors R `YatchewTest::yatchew_test(order=0)` and is used by R `DIDHAD::did_had(yatchew=TRUE)` on placebo rows ("non-parametric pre-trends test" per the package README). Exposed for parity coverage of the placebo-Yatchew rows in `tests/test_did_had_parity.py::TestYatchewParity` (PR #397). The default `"linearity"` mode is paper-derived; users invoking `"mean_independence"` are running an R-parity extension, not a paper-prescribed test.

*Four-step pre-testing workflow (Section 4.2-4.3):*
Shipped as `did_had_pretest_workflow()` in Phase 3 (two-period `aggregate="overall"`) and extended in the Phase 3 follow-up with `aggregate="event_study"` dispatch that closes the step-2 pre-trends gap on multi-period panels. The paper's decision rule for TWFE reliability in HADs:
1. Test the null of a QUG (`H_0: d̲ = 0`) using `qug_test()`.
2. Run a pre-trends test of Assumption 7 (requires at least one earlier pre-period).
3. Test that `E(ΔY | D_2)` is linear (`stute_test` or `yatchew_hr_test`; or the joint Stute variants below in event-study dispatch).
4. If NONE of the three is rejected, `β̂_{fe}` from TWFE may be used to estimate the treatment effect.

**Phase 3 delivery (`aggregate="overall"`, two-period):** `did_had_pretest_workflow()` runs steps 1 + 3 (QUG + Stute + Yatchew). Step 2 is NOT run on this path because a two-period panel has no pre-period placebo horizon to test against; the verdict explicitly flags the Assumption 7 gap via the "paper step 2 deferred" caveat.

**Phase 3 follow-up delivery (`aggregate="event_study"`, multi-period):** `did_had_pretest_workflow(..., aggregate="event_study")` dispatches on a balanced ≥3-period panel. Runs QUG at `F` + joint pre-trends Stute across earlier pre-periods (step 2, mean-independence null) + joint homogeneity-linearity Stute across post-periods (step 3 joint extension, linearity null). Step 2 closure requires at least TWO pre-periods (the base pre-period plus one earlier placebo); on panels with only a single pre-period (the base `F-1`) the workflow emits `pretrends_joint=None` and the verdict flags the skip ("joint pre-trends skipped (no earlier pre-period)"). `all_pass` is False in this degenerate case. The verdict on the event-study path does NOT emit the "paper step 2 deferred" caveat when step 2 runs.

*Algorithm variant - Joint Stute tests (Section 4.2-4.3 joint; Phase 3 follow-up 2026-04):*
Shipped in `diff_diff/had_pretests.py` as `stute_joint_pretest()` (residuals-in core) plus two thin data-in wrappers `joint_pretrends_test()` (mean-independence null) and `joint_homogeneity_test()` (linearity null). Generalizes the single-horizon Stute CvM (above) to K horizons with joint inference.
1. Per-horizon statistic: for each horizon `k`, compute `S_k` via the tie-safe CvM on residuals `ε̂_{g,k}` sorted by dose `D_g`.
2. Joint aggregation: `S_joint = Σ_k S_k` (sum-of-CvMs).
3. Wild bootstrap with **shared** Mammen multiplier `η_g` across horizons per unit — preserves the vector-valued empirical process's unit-level dependence (Delgado-Manteiga 2001; Hlávka-Hušková 2020 for related vector wild-bootstrap theory). Per-horizon OLS refit with shared design matrix precomputes `(X'X)^{-1} X'` once; the bootstrap loop cost per draw is `O(G·p·K)` for K horizons.
4. Per-horizon exact-linear short-circuit: scale- and translation-invariant `Σ eps_k² / centered_TSS_k < _EXACT_LINEAR_RELATIVE_TOL` test applied per horizon. Joint short-circuit fires only when EVERY horizon is machine-exact linear; a single degenerate horizon does not collapse the test when others have nontrivial residuals.
5. Two data-in wrappers:
   - `joint_pretrends_test(pre_periods, base_period)`: `null_form="mean_independence"`, design matrix `[1]`; residuals from `OLS(Y_t - Y_base ~ 1)` per pre-period (paper Section 4.2 footnote 6 + Section 4.3 paragraph 1: "regress Y_1 − Y_0 on a constant [only], then apply CvM to residuals vs D_2").
   - `joint_homogeneity_test(post_periods, base_period)`: `null_form="linearity"`, design matrix `[1, D]`; residuals from `OLS(Y_t - Y_base ~ 1 + D)` per post-period (paper Section 4.3 page 32 joint across post-periods, Pierce-Schott reports p=0.40).
- **Note:** Sum-of-CvMs aggregation is a standard joint specification-test construction (Delgado 1993; Escanciano 2006); the paper does not prescribe an aggregation rule. Sum-of-CvMs balances power across diffuse vs concentrated alternatives and bootstraps cleanly with shared-η.
- **Note:** Event-study dispatch adjudicates step 3 via joint Stute only; there is no joint Yatchew variant because the paper does not derive one. The overall two-period path still uses the Phase 3 "Stute OR Yatchew" adjudication. Users who need Yatchew-style adjacent-difference variance-ratio robustness under multi-period data can run `yatchew_hr_test` on each (base, post) pair manually.
- **Note (Phase 4 — Eq 17 / Eq 18 linear-trend detrending shipped):** `trends_lin: bool = False` (keyword-only) on `HeterogeneousAdoptionDiD.fit(aggregate="event_study")`, `joint_pretrends_test`, and `joint_homogeneity_test` (PR #389, 2026-04). Mirrors R `DIDHAD::did_had(..., trends_lin=TRUE)` (Credible-Answers/did_had v2.0.0, SHA `edc09197`). Per-group linear-trend slope estimated as `Y[g, F-1] - Y[g, F-2]` and applied as `(t - base) × slope` adjustment to per-event-time outcome evolutions (HAD.fit) or to `Y[g, t] - Y[g, base]` directly (joint pretests). The "consumed" placebo at our event-time `e=-2` is auto-dropped (R reduces max placebo lag by 1 with the same effect). Requires F ≥ 3 / `base_period - 1` in panel — front-door `ValueError` if not. Mutually exclusive with survey weighting (raises `NotImplementedError` per `feedback_per_method_survey_element_contract`; weighted slope estimator not derived from paper). Pierce-Schott published-number replication (paper p=0.51 / p=0.40 anchors) deferred indefinitely — primary analysis panel is LBD-restricted (Census FSRDC); the public-deposit proxy panel has filtering ambiguity that prevents exact published-number parity. Replaced by end-to-end R-package parity below, which is a strictly stronger correctness signal.
- **Note (R-package end-to-end parity, PR #389):** Validated against `DIDHAD` v2.0.0 (Credible-Answers/did_had, SHA `edc09197`) on the **`design="continuous_at_zero"` (Design 1') surface**, on 3 paper-derived synthetic DGPs (Uniform, Beta(2,2), Beta(0.5,1)) × 5 method combinations (overall, event-study, placebo, yatchew, trends_lin). Generator: `benchmarks/R/generate_did_had_golden.R`; fixture: `benchmarks/data/did_had_golden.json`; test: `tests/test_did_had_parity.py`. **Scope qualifier (PR #392 R8 P3):** the harness explicitly forces `HeterogeneousAdoptionDiD(design="continuous_at_zero")` because R `did_had` always evaluates the local-linear at `d=0` regardless of dose distribution. Our default `design="auto"` may legitimately resolve to `continuous_near_d_lower` (`d_lower=d.min()`, Design 1) or `mass_point` (Design 2) on dose distributions with boundary density bounded away from zero (e.g., Beta(2,2) at G=200), in which case the WAS estimand evaluates at a different point and diverges from R's `did_had` numerically. That divergence is methodologically defensible — our auto-detect uses more information when boundary mass is sparse — but is out of scope for this parity contract. Tolerances: point estimate / SE / CI bounds at `atol=1e-8`; closed-form Yatchew T-stat at `atol=1e-10` after a documented `× G/(G-1)` finite-sample convention shift. Two intentional convention deviations from R: **(a)** we report the **bias-corrected** point estimate `att = (mean(ΔY) - tau.bc) / mean(D)` (modern CCF 2018 convention); R's `Estimate` column reports the **conventional** estimate `(mean(ΔY) - tau.us) / mean(D)` with the bias-corrected CI separately — our `att` matches R's CI midpoint, our `se` / `conf_int_low` / `conf_int_high` match R's `se` / `ci_lo` / `ci_hi` directly. **(b)** Our `yatchew_hr_test` follows paper Appendix E's literal `(1/G)` and `(1/(2G))` variance-denominator convention; R's `YatchewTest::yatchew_test` uses base-R `var()`'s `(1/(N-1))` sample-variance convention. Ratio is exactly `N/(N-1)`; both converge to the same asymptotic null distribution. Yatchew on placebos with R's mean-independence null (`order=0`, fits `Y ~ 1`) is exposed via `yatchew_hr_test(null="mean_independence")` (added post-PR #392). The parity test routes effect rows through `null="linearity"` (R `order=1`) and placebo rows through `null="mean_independence"` (R `order=0`); both modes share the same `(1/G)` vs `(1/(N-1))` finite-sample convention shift and parity holds at `atol=1e-10` after the documented `× G/(G-1)` transform.
- **Note:** Horizon labels in `StuteJointResult.horizon_labels` are `str(t)` verbatim and carry STRING IDENTITY ONLY — NOT a chronological ordering key. Callers who need chronological order must preserve the original period values alongside (e.g. from the `pre_periods` / `post_periods` argument).
- **Note:** NaN propagation is explicit: when any horizon has NaN in residuals, `cvm_stat_joint=NaN`, `p_value=NaN`, `reject=False`, AND `per_horizon_stats={label: np.nan for every horizon}` (full dict preserved with NaN values — not empty, not partial).

**Phase 3 follow-up delivery:** `stute_joint_pretest()`, `joint_pretrends_test()`, `joint_homogeneity_test()`, `StuteJointResult`, and `did_had_pretest_workflow(aggregate="event_study")` shipped together in PR #353 (2026-04). The `practitioner_next_steps()` HAD handlers landed in Phase 5 wave 1 (PR #402); the T21 HAD pretest workflow tutorial landed in PR #409 (Phase 5 wave 2 first slice). T22 weighted/survey HAD tutorial remains queued.

**Reference implementation(s):**
- R: `did_had` (de Chaisemartin, Ciccia, D'Haultfœuille, Knau 2024a); `stute_test` (2024c); `yatchew_test` (Online Appendix, Table 3).
- Stata: `did_had` (2024b); `stute_test` (2024d); `yatchew_test`. Also `twowayfeweights` (de Chaisemartin, D'Haultfœuille, Deeb 2019) for negative-weight diagnostics.
- Underlying bias-correction machinery: Calonico, Cattaneo, Farrell (2018, 2019) `nprobust`; ported in-house for diff-diff (decision recorded in the plan).

**Requirements checklist (tracks implementation phase completion):**
- [x] Phase 1a: Epanechnikov / triangular / uniform kernels with closed-form `κ_k` constants (`diff_diff/local_linear.py`).
- [x] Phase 1a: Univariate local-linear regression at a boundary (`local_linear_fit` in `diff_diff/local_linear.py`).
- [x] Phase 1a: HC2 + Bell-McCaffrey DOF correction in `diff_diff/linalg.py` via `vcov_type="hc2_bm"` enum (both one-way and CR2 cluster-robust with Imbens-Kolesar / Pustejovsky-Tipton Satterthwaite DOF). Weighted cluster CR2 raises `NotImplementedError` and is tracked as Phase 2+ in `TODO.md`.
    - **Note (scope limitation on absorbed FE):** HC2 and HC2 + Bell-McCaffrey are rejected on any estimator that uses within-transformation (demeaning) for fixed effects: `TwoWayFixedEffects` unconditionally; `DifferenceInDifferences(absorb=..., vcov_type in {"hc2","hc2_bm"})`; `MultiPeriodDiD(absorb=..., vcov_type in {"hc2","hc2_bm"})`. FWL preserves coefficients and residuals under within-transformation but NOT the hat matrix: `h_ii = x_i' (X'X)^{-1} x_i` on the reduced design is not the diagonal of the full FE projection, and CR2's block adjustment `A_g = (I - H_gg)^{-1/2}` likewise depends on the full cluster-block hat matrix. Applying the reduced-design leverage would silently mis-state small-sample SEs/DOF, so the combinations raise `NotImplementedError` with a pointer to workarounds: use `vcov_type="hc1"` (HC1/CR1 have no leverage term and survive FWL), or switch to `fixed_effects=` dummies so the hat matrix is computed on the full design. Lifting the guard requires computing HC2/CR2-BM from the full absorbed projection and validating it against a full-dummy or `fixest`/`clubSandwich` reference. Tracked in `TODO.md` under Methodology/Correctness.
- [x] Phase 1a: `vcov_type` enum threaded through `DifferenceInDifferences` (`MultiPeriodDiD`, `TwoWayFixedEffects` inherit); `robust=True` <=> `vcov_type="hc1"`, `robust=False` <=> `vcov_type="classical"`. Conflict detection at `__init__`. Results summary prints the variance-family label.
    - **Note (deviation from the fully-symmetric enum):** `MultiPeriodDiD(cluster=..., vcov_type="hc2_bm")` is intentionally **not supported** and raises `NotImplementedError`. The scalar-coefficient `DifferenceInDifferences` path handles the cluster + CR2 Bell-McCaffrey combination (`_compute_cr2_bm` returns a per-coefficient Satterthwaite DOF that is valid for the single-ATT contrast), but `MultiPeriodDiD` also reports a post-period-average ATT constructed as a *contrast* of the event-study coefficients. The cluster-aware CR2 BM DOF for that contrast (i.e., the Pustejovsky-Tipton 2018 per-cluster adjustment matrices applied to an arbitrary aggregation contrast) is not yet implemented. Pairing CR2 cluster-robust SEs with the one-way Imbens-Kolesar (2016) contrast DOF would be a broken hybrid, so the combination fails fast with a clear workaround message (drop the cluster for one-way HC2+BM, or use `vcov_type="hc1"` with cluster for CR1 Liang-Zeger). Tracked in `TODO.md` under Methodology/Correctness. Applies only to `MultiPeriodDiD`; `DifferenceInDifferences(cluster=..., vcov_type="hc2_bm")` works.
- [x] Phase 1a: `clubSandwich::vcovCR(..., type="CR2")` parity harness committed: R script at `benchmarks/R/generate_clubsandwich_golden.R` plus a regression-anchor JSON at `benchmarks/data/clubsandwich_cr2_golden.json`. **Note:** the committed JSON currently has `"source": "python_self_reference"` and pins numerical stability only; authoritative R-produced values are generated by running the R script, which the TODO.md row under Methodology/Correctness tracks. The parity test at `tests/test_linalg_hc2_bm.py::TestCR2BMCluster::test_cr2_parity_with_golden` runs at 1e-6 tolerance (Phase 1a plan commits 6-digit parity once R regen completes).
- [x] Phase 1b: Calonico-Cattaneo-Farrell (2018) MSE-optimal bandwidth selector. In-house port of `nprobust::lpbwselect(bwselect="mse-dpi")` (nprobust 0.5.0, SHA `36e4e53`) as `diff_diff.mse_optimal_bandwidth` and `BandwidthResult`, backed by the private `diff_diff._nprobust_port` module (`kernel_W`, `lprobust_bw`, `lpbwselect_mse_dpi`). Three-stage DPI with four `lprobust.bw` calls at orders `q+1`, `q+2`, `q`, `p`. Python matches R to `0.0000%` relative error (i.e., bit-parity within float64 precision, ~8-13 digits agreement) on all five stage bandwidths (`c_bw`, `bw_mp2`, `bw_mp3`, `b_mse`, `h_mse`) across three deterministic DGPs (uniform, Beta(2,2), half-normal) via `benchmarks/R/generate_nprobust_golden.R` → `benchmarks/data/nprobust_mse_dpi_golden.json`. **Note:** `weights=` is currently unsupported (raises `NotImplementedError`); nprobust's `lpbwselect` has no weight argument so there is no parity anchor. Weighted-data support deferred to Phase 2 (survey-design adaptation). **Note (public API scope restriction):** the exported wrapper `mse_optimal_bandwidth` hard-codes the HAD Phase 1b configuration (`p=1`, `deriv=0`, `interior=False`, `vce="nn"`, `nnmatch=3`). The underlying port supports a broader surface (`hc0`/`hc1`/`hc2`/`hc3` variance, interior evaluation, higher `p`), but those paths are not parity-tested against `nprobust` and are deferred. Callers needing the broader surface should use `diff_diff._nprobust_port.lpbwselect_mse_dpi` directly and accept that parity has not been verified on non-HAD configurations. **Note (input contract):** the wrapper enforces HAD's support restriction `D_{g,2} >= 0` (front-door `ValueError` on negative doses and empty inputs). `boundary` must equal `0` (Design 1') or `float(d.min())` (Design 1 continuous-near-d_lower) within float tolerance; off-support values raise `ValueError`. When `boundary ~ 0`, the wrapper additionally requires `d.min() <= 0.05 * median(|d|)` as a Design 1' support plausibility heuristic, chosen to pass the paper's thin-boundary-density DGPs (Beta(2,2), d.min/median ~ 3%) while rejecting substantially off-support samples (U(0.5, 1.0), d.min/median ~ 1.0). Detected mass-point designs (`d.min() > 0` with modal fraction at `d.min() > 2%`) raise `NotImplementedError` pointing to the Phase 2 2SLS path per paper Section 3.2.4.
- [x] Phase 1c: First-order bias estimator `M̂_{ĥ*_G}` and robust variance `V̂_{ĥ*_G}`. Implemented via Calonico-Cattaneo-Titiunik (2014) bias-combined design matrix `Q.q` in the in-house port `diff_diff._nprobust_port.lprobust` (single-eval-point path of `nprobust::lprobust`, npfunctions.R:177-246).
- [x] Phase 1c: Bias-corrected CI (Equation 8) with `nprobust` parity. Public wrapper `diff_diff.bias_corrected_local_linear` returns `BiasCorrectedFit` with μ̂-scale point estimate, robust SE, and bias-corrected 95% CI `[tau.bc ± z_{1-α/2} * se.rb]`. The β-scale rescaling from Equation 8, `(1/G) Σ D_{g,2}`, is applied by Phase 2's `HeterogeneousAdoptionDiD.fit()`. Parity against `nprobust::lprobust(..., bwselect="mse-dpi")` is asserted at `atol=1e-12` on `tau_cl`/`tau_bc`/`se_cl`/`se_rb`/`ci_low`/`ci_high` across the three unclustered golden DGPs (DGP 1 and DGP 3 typically land closer to `1e-13`). The Python wrapper computes its own `z_{1-α/2}` via `scipy.stats.norm.ppf` inside `safe_inference()`; R's `qnorm` value is stored in the golden JSON for audit, and the parity harness compares Python's CI bounds to R's pre-computed CI bounds so any residual drift is purely the floating-point arithmetic in `tau.bc ± z * se.rb`, not a critical-value disagreement. The clustered DGP achieves bit-parity (`atol=1e-14`) when cluster IDs are in first-appearance order; otherwise BLAS reduction ordering can drift to `atol=1e-10`. Generator: `benchmarks/R/generate_nprobust_lprobust_golden.R`. **Note:** The wrapper matches nprobust's `rho=1` default (`b = h` in auto mode), so Phase 1b's separately-computed `b_mse` is surfaced via `bandwidth_diagnostics.b_mse` but not applied. **Note (public-API surface restriction):** Phase 1c restricts the public wrapper's `vce` parameter to `"nn"`; hc0/hc1/hc2/hc3 raise `NotImplementedError` and are queued for Phase 2+ pending dedicated R parity goldens. The port-level `diff_diff._nprobust_port.lprobust` still accepts all five vce modes (matching R's `nprobust::lprobust` signature) for callers who need the broader surface and accept that the hc-mode variance path — which reuses p-fit hat-matrix leverage for the q-fit residual in R (lprobust.R:229-241) — has not been separately parity-tested. **Note (Phase 1c internal bug workaround):** The clustered golden DGP 4 uses manual `h=b=0.3` to sidestep an nprobust-internal singleton-cluster shape bug in `lprobust.vce` fired by the mse-dpi pilot fits; the Python port has no equivalent bug.
- [x] Phase 2a: `HeterogeneousAdoptionDiD` class with separate code paths for Design 1' (`continuous_at_zero`), Design 1 continuous-near-`d̲` (`continuous_near_d_lower`), and Design 1 mass-point. Continuous paths compose Phase 1c's `bias_corrected_local_linear` and form the beta-scale WAS estimate `β̂ = (mean(ΔY) - τ̂_bc) / den` where `τ̂_bc` is the bias-corrected local-linear estimate of the boundary limit `lim_{d↓d̲} E[ΔY | D_2 ≤ d]` and `den = E[D_2]` for Design 1' (paper Theorem 1 / Equation 3 identification; Equation 7 sample estimator) or `den = E[D_2 - d̲]` for Design 1 (paper Theorem 3 / Equation 11, `WAS_{d̲}` under Assumption 6). Mass-point path uses a sample-average 2SLS estimator with instrument `1{D_{g,2} > d̲}` (paper Section 3.2.4).
- [x] Phase 2a: `design="auto"` detection rule (`min_g D_{g,2} < 0.01 · median_g D_{g,2}` → continuous_at_zero; modal-min fraction > 2% → mass_point; else continuous_near_lower). Implemented as strict first-match in `diff_diff.had._detect_design`; when `d.min() == 0` exactly, resolves `continuous_at_zero` unconditionally (modal-min check runs only when `d.min() > 0`). Edge case covered: 3% at `D=0` + 97% `Uniform(0.5, 1)` resolves to `continuous_at_zero`, matching the paper-endorsed Design 1' handling of small-share-of-treated samples.
- [x] Phase 2a: Panel validator (`diff_diff.had._validate_had_panel`) verifies `D_{g,1} = 0` for all units, rejects negative post-period doses (`D_{g,2} < 0`) front-door on the original (unshifted) scale, rejects `>2` time periods on the `aggregate="overall"` path (multi-period panels must use `aggregate="event_study"`, Phase 2b), and rejects unbalanced panels and NaN in outcome/dose/unit columns. Both Design 1 paths (`continuous_near_d_lower` and `mass_point`) additionally require `d_lower == float(d.min())` within float tolerance; mismatched overrides raise with a pointer to the unsupported (LATE-like / off-support) estimand.
- [x] Phase 2a: NaN-propagation tests covering constant-y, degenerate-mass-point, and single-cluster-CR1 inputs. The guaranteed NaN coupling is on the DOWNSTREAM triple (`t_stat`, `p_value`, `conf_int`) via the `safe_inference()` gate, which returns NaN on all three whenever `se` is non-finite, zero, or negative. `att` and `se` themselves are raw estimator outputs: on constant-y / no-dose-variation / divide-by-zero the fit paths return `(att=nan, se=nan)` so all five fields move to NaN together; on the degenerate single-cluster CR1 configuration on the mass-point path, `_fit_mass_point_2sls` returns `(att=beta_hat, se=nan)` - `att` is finite (Wald-IV is well defined) while `se` is NaN, so the downstream triple is NaN while `att` remains the raw 2SLS coefficient. The `assert_nan_inference` fixture in `tests/conftest.py` checks the downstream triple against this contract without requiring `att` to be NaN.
    - **Note (mass-point SE):** Standard errors on the mass-point path use the structural-residual 2SLS sandwich `[Z'X]^{-1} · Ω · [Z'X]^{-T}` with `Ω` built from the structural residuals `u = ΔY - α̂ - β̂·D` (not the reduced-form residuals from an OLS-on-indicator shortcut). Supported: `classical`, `hc1`, and CR1 (cluster-robust) when `cluster=` is supplied. `hc2` and `hc2_bm` raise `NotImplementedError` pending a 2SLS-specific leverage derivation (the OLS leverage `x_i' (X'X)^{-1} x_i` is wrong for 2SLS; the correct finite-sample correction depends on `(Z'X)^{-1}` rather than `(X'X)^{-1}`) plus a dedicated R parity anchor. Queued for the follow-up PR.
    - **Note (Design 1 identification):** `continuous_near_d_lower` and `mass_point` fits emit a `UserWarning` surfacing that `WAS_{d̲}` identification requires Assumption 6 (or Assumption 5 for sign identification only) beyond parallel trends, and that neither is testable via pre-trends. `continuous_at_zero` (Design 1', Assumption 3 only) does not emit this warning.
    - **Note (CI endpoints):** Because the continuous-path `att` is `(mean(ΔY) - τ̂_bc) / den`, the beta-scale CI endpoints reverse relative to the Phase 1c boundary-limit CI: `CI_lower(β̂) = (mean(ΔY) - CI_upper(τ̂_bc)) / den` and `CI_upper(β̂) = (mean(ΔY) - CI_lower(τ̂_bc)) / den`. The `HeterogeneousAdoptionDiD.fit()` implementation computes `att ± z · se` directly via `safe_inference`, which handles the reversal naturally from the transformed point estimate.
    - **Note (Phase 2a/2b scope, superseded by Phase 4.5):** Phase 2a ships the single-period `aggregate="overall"` path; Phase 2b lifts `aggregate="event_study"` (Appendix B.2 multi-period extension) which returns a `HeterogeneousAdoptionDiDEventStudyResults` with per-event-time WAS estimates and pointwise CIs. The original Phase 2a/2b release raised `NotImplementedError` on `survey=` and `weights=`, but Phase 4.5 (A/B/C0) lifted both gates with the per-design vcov contract documented above (see L2340-L2379, including the mass-point `vcov_type="classical"` deviation and `cband=True` sup-t restriction); the `survey=` path composes Binder (1983) TSL via `compute_survey_if_variance` on both continuous and mass-point IFs.
    - **Note (panel-only):** The paper (Section 2) defines HAD on *panel or repeated cross-section* data, but both the overall and event-study paths ship a panel-only implementation: `HeterogeneousAdoptionDiD.fit()` requires a balanced panel with a unit identifier so that unit-level first differences `ΔY_{g,t} = Y_{g,t} - Y_{g,t_anchor}` can be formed. Repeated-cross-section inputs (disjoint unit IDs between periods) are rejected by the balanced-panel validator. RCS support is queued for a follow-up PR (tracked in `TODO.md`); it will need a separate identification path based on pre/post cell means rather than unit-level differences.
- [x] Phase 2b: Multi-period event-study extension (Appendix B.2). `aggregate="event_study"` produces per-event-time WAS estimates using a uniform `F-1` baseline (`ΔY_{g,t} = Y_{g,t} - Y_{g,F-1}` for every horizon), reusing the three Phase 2a design paths on per-horizon first differences. Pre-period placebos included for `e <= -2` (the anchor `e = -1` is skipped since `ΔY = 0` trivially). Post-period estimates for `e >= 0`. The joint Stute test (Equation 18) across pre-periods is a SEPARATE diagnostic deferred to a **Phase 3 follow-up patch** (Phase 3 ships the single-horizon Stute test; the joint stacked-residual variant is tracked in `TODO.md`).
    - **Note (Phase 2b last-cohort filter):** When `first_treat_col` indicates more than one nonzero cohort, the panel is auto-filtered to the last-treatment cohort (`F_last = max(cohorts)`) **plus never-treated units** (`first_treat = 0`), with a `UserWarning` naming kept/dropped unit counts and dropped cohort labels. Paper Appendix B.2 is explicit that HAD "may be used only for the LAST treatment cohort in a staggered design"; the auto-filter implements this prescription, retaining never-treated units per the paper's "there must be an untreated group, at least till the period where the last cohort gets treated" requirement. Only earlier-cohort units (with `first_treat > 0` and `< F_last`) are dropped — never-treated units satisfy the dose invariant at every period (`D = 0` throughout) and preserve Design 1' identifiability (boundary at `0`) when last-cohort doses are uniformly positive. When `first_treat_col` is omitted on a >2-period panel, the validator infers each unit's first-positive-dose period from the dose path; if multiple distinct first-positive-dose cohorts are detected, the estimator raises a front-door `ValueError` directing users to pass `first_treat_col` (which activates the auto-filter) or use `ChaisemartinDHaultfoeuille` for full staggered support — there is no silent acceptance of staggered panels without cohort metadata. Common-adoption panels (single first-positive-dose cohort, or only never-treated + one cohort) pass through unchanged with `F` inferred from the dose invariant, and require dose contiguity (pre-periods < post-periods in natural ordering). Non-contiguous dose sequences (e.g., reverse treatment) raise with a pointer to `ChaisemartinDHaultfoeuille`.
    - **Note (Phase 2b constant-dose requirement):** The event-study aggregation uses `D_{g, F}` (first-treatment-period dose) as the single regressor for every event-time horizon, per paper Appendix B.2's "once treated, stay treated with the same dose" convention. The validator REJECTS panels where a unit has time-varying dose across post-treatment periods (`D_{g, t} != D_{g, F}` for any `t >= F` within-unit, beyond float tolerance) with a front-door `ValueError`, directing users with genuinely time-varying post-treatment doses to `ChaisemartinDHaultfoeuille` (`did_multiplegt_dyn`). Silent acceptance would misattribute later-horizon treatment-effect heterogeneity to the period-F dose. A follow-up PR could implement a time-varying-dose estimator; tracked in `TODO.md`.
    - **Note (Phase 2b per-horizon SE):** Each event-time horizon uses an INDEPENDENT sandwich computed on that horizon's first differences: continuous paths use the CCT-2014 robust SE from Phase 1c divided by `|den|`; mass-point path uses the structural-residual 2SLS sandwich from Phase 2a. This produces pointwise CIs per horizon, matching the paper's Pierce-Schott application (Section 5.2, Figure 2: "nonparametric pointwise CIs"). Joint cross-horizon covariance (IF-based stacking or block bootstrap) is NOT computed — the paper does not derive it and all reported CIs are pointwise. Follow-up PRs may add joint covariance for cross-horizon hypothesis tests; current tracking in `TODO.md`.
    - **Note (Phase 2b baseline convention):** All event-time horizons use a uniform `F-1` anchor: `ΔY_{g,t} = Y_{g,t} - Y_{g,F-1}` for every `t`. This is consistent with the paper's Garrett-et-al. application (Section 5.1: "outcome `Y_{g,t} - Y_{g,2001}`" where `F = 2002`), simplifies event-time indexing (`e = t - F` so `e = -1` is the anchor, skipped), and keeps the implementation symmetric for pre- and post-period horizons. The paper review text's asymmetric "`Y_{g,t} - Y_{g,1}` for pre" / "`Y_{g,t} - Y_{g,F-1}` for post" phrasing is covered by the uniform convention since both give the same placebo interpretation under parallel trends (the paper's own applications use the uniform anchor).
    - **Note (Phase 2b result class):** `aggregate="event_study"` returns a new `HeterogeneousAdoptionDiDEventStudyResults` dataclass (distinct from the single-period `HeterogeneousAdoptionDiDResults`) with per-horizon arrays (`event_times`, `att`, `se`, `t_stat`, `p_value`, `conf_int_low`, `conf_int_high`, `n_obs_per_horizon`) and shared metadata. `to_dataframe()` returns a tidy per-horizon DataFrame; `to_dict()` returns a dict with list-of-per-horizon fields. The static return-type annotation on `fit()` is `HeterogeneousAdoptionDiDResults` (the common case); callers passing `aggregate="event_study"` should annotate their variable as `HeterogeneousAdoptionDiDEventStudyResults` for type checkers.
    - **Note (Phase 3 pretest workflow):** Phase 3 ships the Section 4 pre-test diagnostics in a new module `diff_diff/had_pretests.py` (separate from the 2,800-line `had.py` estimator module). The three tests — `qug_test`, `stute_test`, `yatchew_hr_test` — accept raw `(d, dy)` arrays and return their own result dataclasses (`QUGTestResults`, `StuteTestResults`, `YatchewTestResults`); the composite `did_had_pretest_workflow` accepts a two-period panel and returns `HADPretestReport` with a priority-ordered verdict string. The `data`-only workflow signature (no `result=`-consuming variant) avoids coupling pretests to the `BiasCorrectedFit` internal state, which does not expose residuals. Below-minimum sample sizes emit `UserWarning` and return all-NaN inference (no `ValueError` raise) for library consistency with the `safe_inference` convention; input-shape violations (non-1D, NaN-containing, mismatched length) still raise. No multiple-testing adjustment (Bonferroni/Holm) is applied — the paper does not prescribe one. **Partial-workflow semantic:** the composite runs paper steps 1 (QUG) + 3 (linearity via Stute + Yatchew-HR) only; step 2 (Assumption 7 pre-trends test via Equation 18) is deferred to a Phase 3 follow-up patch. When all three implemented tests fail-to-reject, the verdict explicitly flags the Assumption 7 gap (`"QUG and linearity diagnostics fail-to-reject; Assumption 7 pre-trends test NOT run (paper step 2 deferred to Phase 3 follow-up)"`) rather than claiming unconditional TWFE safety, so callers do not receive a misleading certification signal. The `HADPretestReport` docstring reinforces this caveat. Users should continue to perform their own pre-trends / placebo analysis until the follow-up ships the joint Equation 18 Stute variant.
    - **Note (Phase 3 Stute bootstrap):** The Stute CvM statistic is implemented via the simplified-form `S = (1/G²) · Σ cumsum²`, which is algebraically equivalent to the paper's stated `Σ(g/G)² · ((1/g) Σ eps_{(h)})²` form. Bootstrap follows the paper's Appendix D Algorithm literally: each iteration refits OLS on `dy_b = a_hat + b_hat · d + eps · eta` (null DGP multiplied by Mammen weights). The Appendix-D vectorized matrix form (precomputing `M = I - X(X'X)⁻¹X'` once and applying it to `eps · eta` in each iteration) is functionally identical and ~2× faster; it is deferred as a performance follow-up to keep the Phase 3 reviewer surface small. Bootstrap reproducibility uses `np.random.default_rng(seed)` (library convention, matching `wild_bootstrap_se`); `seed=42` in tests for bitwise stability.
    - **Note (Phase 3 Yatchew normalizer):** `σ̂²_diff` in `yatchew_hr_test` divides by `2G` (paper-literal from Theorem 7), NOT by `2(G-1)`. A unit test hand-computes `σ̂²_diff` at `G=4` on deterministic inputs and asserts the `2G`-normalizer form at `atol=1e-12` so any later regression to the (asymptotically equivalent but finite-sample different) `2(G-1)` form would fail the test. `σ̂⁴_W` uses `np.mean(eps_{(g)}² · eps_{(g-1)}²)` which divides by `G-1` via `np.mean` length, matching the paper's Theorem 7 / Equation 29 normalization.
    - **Note (Phase 3 Yatchew tie policy):** `yatchew_hr_test` REJECTS duplicate dose values with a `UserWarning` + all-NaN result at the front door. The difference-based variance estimator `σ̂²_diff` and the heteroskedasticity-robust scale `σ̂⁴_W` both use adjacent differences (of sorted dy and of adjacent squared residuals, respectively); under tied doses the within-tie row ordering is arbitrary (stable sort falls back to input order), so the statistic becomes non-methodological and order-dependent. Callers with tied doses (mass-point designs, discretised dose registers) should use `stute_test` instead — its tie-safe Cramer-von Mises statistic collapses tie blocks to the post-tie cumulative sum and is provably order-invariant under within-tie permutations. A regression test on `stute_test` asserts bit-identical `cvm_stat` across tied-dose permutations at `atol=1e-14`; a matching regression on `yatchew_hr_test` asserts the NaN+warning behavior on duplicated and constant doses. This tie policy is a Phase 3 diff-diff choice (the paper describes Yatchew only as "sort by D" and does not specify a tie rule); an alternative implementation could document a justified tie-resolution convention and back it with permutation tests, but at the cost of a methodology surface the paper does not cover. **Workflow fallback:** `did_had_pretest_workflow` follows the paper's "Stute OR Yatchew" step-3 wording — a conclusive Stute (which is tie-safe) is sufficient to adjudicate linearity even when Yatchew returns NaN on tied-dose panels. The composite verdict then reads "QUG and linearity diagnostics fail-to-reject (Yatchew NaN - skipped); ..." rather than forcing the whole report to "inconclusive", and `all_pass` is `True` when QUG + at least one conclusive linearity test fail-to-reject.
    - **Note (Phase 3 exact-linear short-circuit):** Both `stute_test` and `yatchew_hr_test` detect numerically-exact linear fits (OLS residuals below machine precision relative to the signal) and short-circuit to `p=1.0, reject=False` without running the bootstrap / computing `T_hr`. The detection compares `sum(eps^2)` against the CENTERED total sum of squares `sum((dy - dybar)^2)` (ratio `<= 1e-24`), which is equivalent to `1 - R^2` and is TRANSLATION-INVARIANT under additive shifts in dy. Comparing against uncentered `sum(dy^2)` would NOT be translation-invariant: adding a large constant to dy inflates `sum(dy^2)` and can spuriously trip the short-circuit on genuinely noisy data. Regression tests pin (a) the exact-linear fail-to-reject behavior for `dy = a + b*d`, (b) translation-invariance under `dy -> dy + 1e12` (the short-circuit must not fire on noisy data regardless of the constant offset).
- [x] Phase 3: `qug_test()` (`T = D_{2,(1)} / (D_{2,(2)} - D_{2,(1)})`, rejection `{T > 1/α - 1}`). One-sided asymptotic p-value `1 / (1 + T)` under the Exp(1)/Exp(1) limit law (Theorem 4). Zero-dose observations filtered upfront (with `UserWarning`); `D_{(1)} == D_{(2)}` tie returns all-NaN inference (conservative). Closed-form tight parity tested at `atol=1e-12`.
- [x] Phase 3: `stute_test()` Cramér-von Mises with Mammen wild bootstrap. Statistic `S = (1/G^2) Σ (cumsum_g)^2` (algebraically equivalent to paper's `Σ(g/G)^2 · ((1/g) Σ eps_{(h)})^2`). Bootstrap follows paper Appendix D Algorithm literal (per-iteration OLS refit). `n_bootstrap=999` default, `n_bootstrap >= 99` validated. `G < 10` returns NaN; `G > 100_000` emits a `UserWarning` pointing to `yatchew_hr_test`. Appendix-D vectorized matrix form deferred as a performance follow-up (tracked in `TODO.md`).
- [x] Phase 3: `yatchew_hr_test()` heteroskedasticity-robust specification test. Test statistic `T_hr = sqrt(G) · (σ̂²_lin - σ̂²_diff) / σ̂²_W` from paper Equation 29. Normalizer `σ̂²_diff` divides by `2G` (paper-literal Theorem 7), NOT `2(G-1)`; hand-computed tight parity asserted at `atol=1e-12`. One-sided standard-normal critical value. `G < 3` returns NaN. Phase 3 shipped only the linearity null (paper Theorem 7); the `null="mean_independence"` R-parity extension shipped post-PR #392 (see the algorithm-variant block above for the contract).
- [x] Phase 3: `did_had_pretest_workflow()` composite helper. Two-period `data`-only entry point (Phase 2a overall-path dispatch); reduces panel via `_aggregate_first_difference` and runs all three IMPLEMENTED tests at a shared `alpha`. `seed` forwards to `stute_test` only (QUG and Yatchew are deterministic). Returns `HADPretestReport` with priority-ordered verdict string. Because Phase 3 ships steps 1 + 3 of the paper's four-step workflow but **not** step 2 (Assumption 7 pre-trends test via Equation 18), the fail-to-reject verdict explicitly flags the Assumption 7 gap rather than claiming unconditional TWFE safety: `"QUG and linearity diagnostics fail-to-reject; Assumption 7 pre-trends test NOT run (paper step 2 deferred to Phase 3 follow-up)"`. Verdict priority follows the paper's one-way rule (TWFE admissible only if NO test rejects): **conclusive rejections are the primary verdict and are NEVER hidden by inconclusive status** — any unresolved-step note is appended via `"; additional steps unresolved: ..."` rather than replacing the rejection. The pure `"inconclusive - QUG NaN"` / `"inconclusive - both Stute and Yatchew linearity tests NaN"` forms only fire when NO conclusive test rejects AND a required step is unresolved. The partial-workflow fail-to-reject verdict may carry a `"(Yatchew NaN - skipped)"` (or Stute) suffix when one linearity test is NaN but the other is conclusive (step 3 resolved via the paper's "Stute OR Yatchew" wording). Bundled rejection-reason strings name each failed assumption in the conclusive-rejection case. `all_pass` is `True` iff QUG is conclusive AND at least one of Stute/Yatchew is conclusive AND no conclusive test rejects. **Non-negative-dose contract**: all three raw linearity helpers (`qug_test`, `stute_test`, `yatchew_hr_test`) raise a front-door `ValueError` on any `d < 0`, mirroring the `_validate_had_panel` guard (paper Section 2 HAD support restriction). Multi-period panels pre-slice to `(F-1, F)` before calling; joint-horizon dispatch deferred to Phase 3 follow-up.

# Diagnostics & Sensitivity

## PlaceboTests

**Module:** `diff_diff/diagnostics.py`

*Edge cases:*
- NaN inference for undefined statistics:
  - `permutation_test`: t_stat is NaN when permutation SE is zero (all permutations produce identical estimates)
  - `leave_one_out_test`: t_stat, p_value, CI are NaN when LOO SE is zero (all LOO effects identical)
  - **Note**: Defensive enhancement matching CallawaySantAnna NaN convention

## BaconDecomposition

**Primary source:** [Goodman-Bacon, A. (2021). Difference-in-differences with variation in treatment timing. *Journal of Econometrics*, 225(2), 254-277.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2021.03.014)

**Key implementation requirements:**

*Assumption checks / warnings:*
- Requires variation in treatment timing (staggered adoption)
- Warns if only one treatment cohort (decomposition not meaningful)
- Uses never-treated units as controls when present; falls back to timing-only comparisons otherwise

*Estimator equation (as implemented):*

TWFE decomposes as:
```
τ̂^TWFE = Σ_k s_k × τ̂_k
```
where k indexes 2×2 comparisons and s_k are Bacon weights.

Three comparison types:
1. **Treated vs. Never-treated** (if never-treated exist):
   ```
   τ̂_{T,U} = (Ȳ_{T,post} - Ȳ_{T,pre}) - (Ȳ_{U,post} - Ȳ_{U,pre})
   ```

2. **Earlier vs. Later-treated** (Earlier as treated, Later as control pre-treatment):
   ```
   τ̂_{k,l} = DiD using early-treated as treatment, late-treated as control
   ```

3. **Later vs. Earlier-treated** (problematic: uses post-treatment outcomes as control):
   ```
   τ̂_{l,k} = DiD using late-treated as treatment, early-treated (post) as control
   ```

Weights depend on group sizes and variance in treatment timing.

*Standard errors:*
- Not typically computed (decomposition is exact)
- Individual 2×2 estimates can have SEs

*Edge cases:*
- Continuous treatment: not supported, requires binary
- Weights may be negative for later-vs-earlier comparisons
- Single treatment time: no decomposition possible

**Reference implementation(s):**
- R: `bacondecomp::bacon()`
- Stata: `bacondecomp`

**Requirements checklist:**
- [ ] Three comparison types: treated_vs_never, earlier_vs_later, later_vs_earlier
- [ ] Weights sum to approximately 1 (numerical precision)
- [ ] TWFE coefficient ≈ weighted sum of 2×2 estimates
- [ ] Visualization shows weight vs. estimate by comparison type
- [x] Survey design support (Phase 3): weighted cell means, weighted within-transform, weighted group shares
- **Note:** Bacon decomposition with survey weights is diagnostic; exact-sum guarantee is approximate; `weights="exact"` requires within-unit-constant survey columns (approximate path accepts time-varying weights)

## HonestDiD

**Primary source:** [Rambachan, A., & Roth, J. (2023). A More Credible Approach to Parallel Trends. *Review of Economic Studies*, 90(5), 2555-2591.](https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdad018)

**Key implementation requirements:**

*Assumption checks / warnings:*
- Requires event-study estimates with pre-treatment coefficients
- Warns if pre-treatment coefficients suggest parallel trends violation
- M=0 for Delta^SD: enforces linear trend extrapolation (not exact parallel trends)

*Restriction classes (Equations 8, Section 2.3):*

Delta^SD(M) — Smoothness (second differences, all periods):
```
Δ^SD(M) = {δ : |(δ_{t+1} − δ_t) − (δ_t − δ_{t-1})| ≤ M, for all t}
```
with δ_0 = 0 at the pre-post boundary. M=0 enforces linear trends.

Delta^RM(M̄) — Relative magnitudes (post-treatment first differences):
```
Δ^RM(M̄) = {δ : |δ_{t+1} − δ_t| ≤ M̄ × max_{s<0} |δ_{s+1} − δ_s|, for all t ≥ 0}
```
Post-treatment consecutive first differences bounded by M̄ × max pre-treatment first difference. Union of polyhedra (one per max location).

*Identified set (Equations 5-6):*
```
θ^lb = l'β_post − max{l'δ_post : δ ∈ Δ, δ_pre = β_pre}
θ^ub = l'β_post − min{l'δ_post : δ ∈ Δ, δ_pre = β_pre}
```
CRITICAL: δ_pre = β_pre pins pre-treatment violations to observed coefficients. Solved via LP (scipy.optimize.linprog).

*Inference (Sections 3.2, 4.1):*
- Delta^SD: Optimal FLCI — jointly optimizes affine estimator direction and half-length via folded normal quantile cv_α(bias/se) (Equation 18). When `df_survey` is present, uses folded non-central t (`scipy.stats.nct`) instead of folded normal; `df_survey=0` → NaN inference. For M=0, uses `_get_critical_value(alpha, df)` (standard t/z).
- Delta^RM: Paper recommends ARP conditional/hybrid confidence sets (Equations 14-15, κ = α/10). Currently uses **naive FLCI** unconditionally (conservative — wider CIs, valid coverage). ARP infrastructure exists but is disabled.
- **Note (deviation from R):** Delta^RM CIs use naive FLCI (`lb - z*se, ub + z*se`) instead of the paper's ARP hybrid. R's `HonestDiD` package implements full ARP conditional/hybrid. Our naive FLCI is conservative (wider, valid coverage) but does not adapt to the length of the identified set. ARP implementation deferred (see TODO.md).
- **Note:** `method="combined"` (Delta^SDRM) uses naive FLCI on the intersection of Delta^SD and Delta^RM bounds. The paper proves FLCI is NOT consistent for Delta^SDRM (Proposition 4.2). The paper recommends ARP hybrid for non-SD restriction classes. This is a known conservative approximation; a runtime UserWarning is emitted.

*Standard errors:*
- Inherits Σ̂ from underlying event-study estimation
- Sensitivity analysis reports identified set bounds and confidence sets

*Edge cases:*
- M=0 for Δ^SD: linear extrapolation, point identification, FLCI near-optimal
- M̄=0 for Δ^RM: post-treatment first differences = 0, point identification
- Breakdown point: smallest M where CI includes zero
- Negative M: not valid (constraints become infeasible)
- **Note:** Phase 7d: survey variance support. When input results carry `survey_metadata` with `df_survey`, Delta^SD smoothness uses folded non-central t critical values (`scipy.stats.nct`); Delta^RM and naive FLCI paths use `_get_critical_value(alpha, df)` (standard t-distribution). `df_survey=0` → NaN inference. CallawaySantAnnaResults stores `event_study_vcov` (full cross-event-time VCV from IF vectors), which HonestDiD uses instead of the diagonal fallback. For replicate-weight designs, the event-study VCV falls back to diagonal (multivariate replicate VCV deferred).
- **Note (deviation from R):** When HonestDiD receives bootstrap-fitted CallawaySantAnna results (`n_bootstrap > 0`), the full event-study covariance is unavailable (cleared to prevent mixing analytical VCV with bootstrap SEs). HonestDiD falls back to `diag(se^2)` from the bootstrap SEs with a UserWarning. R's `honest_did.AGGTEobj` computes a full covariance from the influence function matrix; implementing bootstrap event-study covariance is deferred. For full covariance structure in HonestDiD, use analytical SEs (`n_bootstrap=0`).
- **Note (deviation from R):** When CallawaySantAnna results are passed to HonestDiD, `base_period != "universal"` emits a warning but does not error. R's `honest_did::honest_did.AGGTEobj` requires universal base period. Our implementation warns because the varying-base pre-treatment coefficients use consecutive comparisons (not a common reference), which changes the parallel-trends restriction interpretation.

**Reference implementation(s):**
- R: `HonestDiD` package (Rambachan & Roth's official package)

**Requirements checklist:**
- [x] Δ^SD constrains second differences with δ_0 = 0 boundary handling
- [x] Δ^RM constrains first differences (not levels), union of polyhedra
- [x] Identified set LP pins δ_pre = β_pre (Equations 5-6)
- [x] Optimal FLCI for Δ^SD (convex optimization, folded normal quantile)
- [x] ARP hybrid framework for Δ^RM (vertex enumeration, truncated normal)
- [x] Sensitivity analysis over M/M̄ grid with breakdown value
- [x] M parameter must be ≥ 0
- [ ] ARP hybrid produces valid (non-degenerate) CIs for all test cases

**Key implementation requirements:**

*Assumption checks / warnings:*
- Requires specification of variance-covariance matrix of pre-treatment estimates
- Warns if pre-trends test has low power (uninformative)
- Different violation types have different power properties

*Estimator equation (as implemented):*

MDV(power=0.8) = min{|δ| : Power(δ) ≥ 0.8}
```

Violation types:
- **Linear**: δ_t = c × t (linear pre-trend)
- **Constant**: δ_t = c (level shift)
- **Last period**: δ_{-1} = c, others zero
- **Custom**: user-specified pattern

*Standard errors:*
- Power calculations are exact (no sampling variability)
- Uncertainty comes from estimated Σ

*Edge cases:*
- Perfect collinearity in pre-periods: test not well-defined
- Single pre-period: power calculation trivial
- Very high power: MDV approaches zero

**Reference implementation(s):**
- R: `pretrends` package (Roth's official package)

**Requirements checklist:**
- [ ] MDV = minimum detectable violation at target power level
- [ ] Violation types: linear, constant, last_period, custom all implemented
- [ ] Power curve plotting over violation magnitudes
- [ ] Integrates with HonestDiD for combined sensitivity analysis

- Burlig, F., Preonas, L., & Woerman, M. (2020). Panel Data and Experimental Design. *Journal of Development Economics*, 144, 102458.

**Key implementation requirements:**

*Assumption checks / warnings:*
- Requires specification of outcome variance and intraclass correlation
- Warns if power is very low (<0.5) or sample size insufficient
- Cluster randomization requires cluster-level parameters

*Estimator equation (as implemented):*

Minimum detectable effect (MDE):
```
MDE = (t_{α/2} + t_{1-κ}) × SE(τ̂)
```
where κ is target power (typically 0.8).

Standard error for DiD:
```
SE(τ̂) = σ × √(1/n_T + 1/n_C) × √(1 + ρ(m-1)) / √(1 - R²)
```
where:
- ρ = intraclass correlation
- m = cluster size
- R² = variance explained by covariates

Power function:
```
Power = Φ(|τ|/SE - z_{α/2})
```

Sample size for target power:
```
n = 2(t_{α/2} + t_{1-κ})² σ² / MDE²
```

*Standard errors:*
- Analytical formulas (no estimation uncertainty in power calculation)
- Simulation-based power accounts for finite-sample and model-specific factors

*Edge cases:*
- Very small effects: may require infeasibly large samples
- High ICC: dramatically reduces effective sample size
- Unequal allocation: optimal is often 50-50 but depends on costs
- **Note:** `data_generator_kwargs` keys that overlap with registry-managed simulation inputs (`treatment_effect`, `noise_sd`, `n_units`, `n_periods`, `treatment_fraction`, `treatment_period`, `n_pre`, `n_post`) are rejected with `ValueError` to prevent silent desync between the DGP and result metadata. `n_pre` and `n_post` are derived from `treatment_period` and `n_periods` in factor-model DGPs (SyntheticDiD, TROP); the 3-way intersection check naturally scopes the rejection to those estimators only. Use the corresponding `simulate_power()` parameters directly, or pass a custom `data_generator` to override the DGP entirely.
- **Note:** `simulate_sample_size()` rejects `n_per_cell` in `data_generator_kwargs` for `TripleDifference` because `n_per_cell` is derived from `n_units` (the search variable). A fixed override would freeze the effective sample size across bisection iterations, making the search degenerate. Use `simulate_power()` with a fixed `n_per_cell` override instead, or pass a custom `data_generator`.
- **Note:** The simulation-based power registry (`simulate_power`, `simulate_mde`, `simulate_sample_size`) uses a single-cohort staggered DGP by default. Estimators configured with `control_group="not_yet_treated"`, `clean_control="strict"`, or `anticipation>0` will receive a `UserWarning` because the default DGP does not match their identification strategy. Users must supply `data_generator_kwargs` (e.g., `cohort_periods=[2, 4]`, `never_treated_frac=0.0`) or a custom `data_generator` to match the estimator design.
- **Note:** The `TripleDifference` registry adapter uses `generate_ddd_data`, a fixed 2×2×2 factorial DGP (group × partition × time). The `n_periods`, `treatment_period`, and `treatment_fraction` parameters are ignored — DDD always simulates 2 periods with balanced groups. `n_units` is mapped to `n_per_cell = max(2, n_units // 8)` (effective total N = `n_per_cell × 8`), so non-multiples of 8 are rounded down and values below 16 are clamped to 16. A `UserWarning` is emitted when simulation inputs differ from the effective DDD design. When rounding occurs, all result objects (`SimulationPowerResults`, `SimulationMDEResults`, `SimulationSampleSizeResults`) set `effective_n_units` to the actual sample size used; it is `None` when no rounding occurred. `simulate_sample_size()` snaps bisection candidates to multiples of 8 so that `required_n` is always a realizable DDD sample size. Passing `n_per_cell` in `data_generator_kwargs` suppresses the effective-N rounding warning but not warnings for ignored parameters (`n_periods`, `treatment_period`, `treatment_fraction`).
- **Note:** The analytical power methods (`PowerAnalysis.power/mde/sample_size` and the `compute_power/compute_mde/compute_sample_size` convenience functions) accept a `deff` parameter (survey design effect, default 1.0). This inflates variance multiplicatively: `Var(ATT) *= deff`, and inflates required sample size: `n_total *= deff`. The `deff` parameter is **not redundant** with `rho` (intra-cluster correlation): `rho` models within-unit serial correlation in panel data via the Moulton factor `1 + (T-1)*rho`, while `deff` models the survey design effect from stratified multi-stage sampling (clustering + unequal weighting). A survey panel study may need both. Values `deff > 0` are accepted; `deff < 1.0` (net variance reduction, e.g., from stratification gain) emits a warning.
- **Note:** `simulate_power()` catches a narrow set of exception types — `ValueError`, `numpy.linalg.LinAlgError`, `KeyError`, `RuntimeError`, `ZeroDivisionError` — raised inside the per-simulation fit and result-extraction block, increments a per-effect failure counter, and skips the replicate. Programming errors (`TypeError`, `AttributeError`, `NameError`, `IndexError`, etc.) are allowed to propagate so that bugs in the estimator or custom result extractor surface loudly instead of being absorbed as simulation failures. The primary-effect failure count is surfaced on the result object as `SimulationPowerResults.n_simulation_failures`; a `UserWarning` still fires when the failure rate exceeds 10% for any effect size, and all-failed runs raise `RuntimeError`. This replaces the prior bare `except Exception` that swallowed root causes and kept the counter internal to the function (axis C — silent fallback — under the Phase 2 audit).
- **Note:** `SurveyPowerConfig._build_survey_design()` no longer caches its return value in `self._cached_survey_design`. Reassigning `config.survey_design` (either replacing a user-supplied `SurveyDesign` with another, or toggling between `None` and a user-supplied design) after the first call used to silently return the stale cached design; the method now returns the live `self.survey_design` (or the default construction when `None`) every call. Other config fields (`n_strata`, `icc`, `weight_variation`, etc.) never influenced the returned design, so the staleness surface was specifically `survey_design` reassignment. Construction is microseconds — the cache never earned its complexity. Axis-J finding #28 in the Phase 2 silent-failures audit.
- **Note:** The simulation-based power functions (`simulate_power/simulate_mde/simulate_sample_size`) accept a `survey_config` parameter (`SurveyPowerConfig` dataclass). When set, the simulation loop uses `generate_survey_did_data` instead of the default registry DGP, and automatically injects `SurveyDesign(weights="weight", strata="stratum", psu="psu", fpc="fpc")` into the estimator's `fit()` call. Supported estimators: DifferenceInDifferences, TwoWayFixedEffects, MultiPeriodDiD, CallawaySantAnna, SunAbraham, ImputationDiD, TwoStageDiD, StackedDiD, EfficientDiD. Unsupported (raises `ValueError`): TROP, SyntheticDiD, TripleDifference (generate_survey_did_data produces staggered cohort data incompatible with factor-model/DDD DGPs). `survey_config` and `data_generator` are mutually exclusive. `data_generator_kwargs` may not contain keys managed by `SurveyPowerConfig` (n_strata, psu_per_stratum, etc.) but may contain passthrough DGP params (unit_fe_sd, add_covariates, strata_sizes). Repeated cross-section survey power (`panel=False`) is only supported for `CallawaySantAnna(panel=False)` with a matching `data_generator_kwargs={"panel": False}`; both mismatch directions are rejected. `estimator_kwargs` may not contain `survey_design` when `survey_config` is set (use `SurveyPowerConfig(survey_design=...)` instead). Estimator settings that require a multi-cohort DGP (`control_group="not_yet_treated"`, `control_group="last_cohort"`, `clean_control="strict"`) are rejected because the survey DGP uses a single cohort; use the custom `data_generator` path for these configurations. `simulate_sample_size` raises the bisection floor to `n_strata * psu_per_stratum * 2` to ensure viable survey structure and rejects `strata_sizes` in `data_generator_kwargs` (it depends on `n_units` which varies during bisection).

**Reference implementation(s):**

# Visualization

## Event Study Plotting (`plot_event_study`)

**Reference Period Normalization**

Normalization only occurs when `reference_period` is **explicitly specified** by the user:

- **Explicit `reference_period=X`**: Normalizes effects (subtracts ref effect), sets ref SE to NaN
  - Point estimates: `effect_normalized = effect - effect_ref`
  - Reference period SE → NaN (it's now a constraint, not an estimate)
  - Other periods' SEs unchanged (uncertainty relative to the constraint)
  - CIs recomputed from normalized effects and original SEs

- **Auto-inferred reference** (from CallawaySantAnna results): Hollow marker styling only, no normalization
  - Original effects are plotted unchanged
  - Reference period shown with hollow marker for visual indication
  - All periods retain their original SEs and error bars

This design prevents unintended normalization when the reference period isn't a true
identifying constraint (e.g., CallawaySantAnna with `base_period="varying"` where different
cohorts use different comparison periods).

The explicit-only normalization follows the `fixest` (R) convention where the omitted/reference
category is an identifying constraint with no associated uncertainty. Auto-inferred references
follow the `did` (R) package convention which does not normalize and reports full inference.

**Rationale**: When normalizing to a reference period, we're treating that period as an
identifying constraint (effect ≡ 0 by definition). The variance of a constant is zero,
but since it's a constraint rather than an estimated quantity, we report NaN rather than 0.
Auto-inferred references may not represent true identifying constraints, so normalization
should be a deliberate user choice.

**Edge Cases:**
- If `reference_period` not in data: No normalization applied
- If reference effect is NaN: No normalization applied
- Reference period CI becomes (NaN, NaN) after normalization (explicit only)
- Reference period is plotted with hollow marker (both explicit and auto-inferred)
- Reference period error bars: removed for explicit, retained for auto-inferred

**Reference implementation(s):**
- R: `fixest::coefplot()` with reference category shown at 0 with no CI
- R: `did::ggdid()` does not normalize; shows full inference for all periods

## Survey Data Support

Survey-weighted estimation allows correct population-level inference from data
collected via complex survey designs (multi-stage sampling, stratification,
unequal selection probabilities).

### Weighted Estimation

- **Reference**: Lumley (2004) "Analysis of Complex Survey Samples", Journal of
  Statistical Software 9(8). Solon, Haider, & Wooldridge (2015) "What Are We
  Weighting For?" Journal of Human Resources 50(2).
- **WLS formula**: `beta_WLS = (X'WX)^{-1} X'Wy` where `W = diag(w_i)`
- **Implementation**: Equivalent transformation via `sqrt(w)` scaling, then
  standard OLS. Residuals back-transformed to original scale.
- **Weight types**: pweight (inverse selection probability), fweight
  (frequency/expansion), aweight (inverse variance/precision)
- **Note:** Weight normalization uses `sum(w) = n` convention (DRDID/Stata), not
  raw weights (R `survey`). Coefficients are identical; SEs differ by constant
  factor.

### Taylor Series Linearization (TSL) Variance

- **Reference**: Binder (1983) "On the Variances of Asymptotically Normal
  Estimators from Complex Surveys", International Statistical Review 51(3).
  Lumley (2004).
- **Formula**: `V_TSL = (X'WX)^{-1} [sum_h V_h] (X'WX)^{-1}` with stratified
  PSU-level scores
- **Relationship to sandwich estimator**: TSL is a generalization of the
  Huber-White sandwich estimator that accounts for stratification and finite
  population correction
- **Deviation from R:** R `survey` defaults `lonely_psu` to "fail"; we default
  to "remove" with warning, matching common applied practice
- **Edge case**: Singleton strata (one PSU per stratum) — handled via
  `lonely_psu` parameter ("remove", "certainty", or "adjust")
- **Note:** For unstratified designs with a single PSU, all `lonely_psu` modes
  produce NaN variance. The "adjust" mode cannot center against a global mean
  when there is only one stratum (the single PSU is the entire sample).
- **Note:** Weights-only designs (no explicit PSU or strata) use implicit
  per-observation PSUs for the TSL meat computation, consistent with the
  stratified-no-PSU path. The adjustment factor is `n/(n-1)` (not HC1's
  `n/(n-k)`).
- **Note:** TSL now precondition-checks `X'WX` via `np.linalg.cond` before
  solving the sandwich. If the condition number exceeds `1/sqrt(eps)` (≈
  6.7e7) a `UserWarning` fires stating that the bread is ill-conditioned
  and variance estimates may be numerically unstable. Previously a near-
  singular `X'WX` could silently produce unstable SEs. Axis-A finding #19
  in the Phase 2 silent-failures audit.

### Weight Type Effects on Inference

- **Note:** aweights use unweighted meat in the sandwich estimator (no `w` in
  `u^2` term). This matches Stata convention. Rationale: aweights model known
  heteroskedasticity; after WLS transformation, errors are approximately
  homoskedastic.
- **Note:** fweights affect degrees of freedom (`df = sum(w) - k`, not
  `n - k`). This matches Stata convention for frequency-expanded data.
- **Note:** pweight HC1 meat uses score outer products (Σ s_i s_i' where
  s_i = w_i x_i u_i), giving w² in the meat. fweight HC1 meat uses
  X'diag(w u²)X (one power of w), matching frequency-expanded HC1.
- **Note:** fweights must be non-negative integers; fractional values are
  rejected by `_validate_weights()`. All-zero vectors rejected at solver
  level. This matches Stata's convention.

### Absorbed Fixed Effects with Survey Weights

- **Note:** When `absorb` is used with a single variable in DiD/MultiPeriodDiD,
  all regressors (treatment, time, interactions, covariates) are within-transformed
  alongside the outcome per the FWL theorem. Regressors collinear with
  the absorbed FE (e.g., treatment after absorbing unit FE) are dropped
  via rank-deficiency handling. Multiple absorbed variables with survey weights
  are rejected (single-pass sequential demeaning is not the correct weighted
  FWL projection for N > 1 dimensions; iterative alternating projections are
  needed but not yet implemented).
- **Note:** The shared weighted within-transformation path
  (`diff_diff.utils.within_transform`, hit whenever `weights is not None`) emits
  a `UserWarning` per call when any transformed variable exits the
  alternating-projection loop without reaching `tol` within `max_iter`.
  Defaults: `max_iter=100`, `tol=1e-8`. This signal applies uniformly across
  TwoWayFixedEffects, SunAbraham, BaconDecomposition, and WooldridgeDiD whenever
  they route through this helper (survey-weighted or otherwise). Silent return
  of the current iterate was classified as a silent failure under the Phase 2
  audit and replaced with this explicit signal.

### Survey Degrees of Freedom

- **Reference**: Korn & Graubard (1990) "Simultaneous Testing of Regression
  Coefficients with Complex Survey Data", JASA 85(409).
- **Formula**: `df = n_PSU - n_strata` (replaces `n - k` for t-distribution
  inference)
- **Deviation from R:** Some software uses Satterthwaite-type df approximation;
  we use the simpler and more common `n_PSU - n_strata` convention.
- **Note:** When no explicit PSU is specified (weights-only or stratified-no-PSU
  designs), each observation is treated as its own PSU for df purposes. Survey df
  becomes `n_obs - n_strata` (or `n_obs - 1` when unstratified).
- **Note:** When survey_design specifies weights only (no PSU) and cluster=
  is specified, cluster IDs are injected as effective PSUs for Taylor Series
  Linearization variance estimation, matching the R `survey` package
  convention that clusters are the primary sampling units.

### Survey Aggregation (`aggregate_survey`)

Aggregation of individual-level survey microdata to geographic-period cells with
design-based precision estimates, for use as a pre-processing step before panel
DiD estimation on repeated cross-section survey data.

- **Reference**: Lumley (2004) "Analysis of Complex Survey Samples", Journal of
  Statistical Software 9(8), Section 3.4 (domain estimation).
- **Cell mean**: Design-weighted mean `ȳ_g = Σ w_i y_i / Σ w_i` for each cell g
  defined by grouping columns (e.g., state × year).
- **Cell variance**: Each cell is treated as a subpopulation/domain of the full
  survey design (consistent with `SurveyDesign.subpopulation()` and the
  Subpopulation Analysis section below). The influence function
  `ψ_i = w_i (y_i - ȳ_g) / Σ w_j` is zero-padded outside the cell, preserving
  full strata/PSU structure for variance estimation via `compute_survey_if_variance()`
  (TSL) or `compute_replicate_if_variance()` (replicate designs).
- **Second-stage weights** (`second_stage_weights` parameter):
  - `"pweight"` (default): Population weight = mean of per-cell `Σ w_i` within each
    geographic unit (first `by` column), constant across periods. Proportional to
    the Horvitz-Thompson estimated population count, averaged over periods to
    satisfy the unit-constant survey column contract required by panel estimators.
    Compatible with all survey-capable estimators including pweight-only estimators
    (CallawaySantAnna, ImputationDiD, TwoStageDiD, StackedDiD, etc.).
  - `"aweight"`: Precision weight = `1 / V(ȳ_g)` (inverse variance). Produces
    efficiency-weighted estimates via WLS. Compatible only with estimators that
    accept aweight (DifferenceInDifferences, TwoWayFixedEffects, MultiPeriodDiD,
    SunAbraham, ContinuousDiD, EfficientDiD).
  - **Reference**: Solon, Haider & Wooldridge (2015) "What Are We Weighting For?",
    Journal of Human Resources 50(2), 301-316. Population weights estimate the
    population parameter; precision weights are efficient under correct variance
    specification. Both are valid with heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors.
  - **Reference**: Donald & Lang (2007) "Inference with Difference-in-Differences
    and Other Panel Data", Review of Economics and Statistics 89(2), 221-233.
  - **Note:** The pweight default matches the R `did` package convention where
    `weightsname` accepts sampling/population weights, not inverse-variance weights.
- **Note:** SRS fallback when design-based variance is unidentifiable (e.g., all
  strata contribute zero variance) or when the cell has fewer than `min_n` valid
  observations. Formula: `V_SRS = Σ w_i(y_i - ȳ)² / (Σ w_j)² × n/(n-1)`.
  Cells using SRS fallback are flagged via `srs_fallback` column.
- **Edge case**: Zero-variance cells (all observations identical) set precision to
  NaN. Under aweight mode this maps to weight 0.0; under pweight mode the cell
  retains its positive population weight.

### Survey-Aware Bootstrap (Phase 6)

Two strategies for bootstrap variance under complex survey designs:

**Multiplier Bootstrap at PSU Level** (CallawaySantAnna, ImputationDiD, TwoStageDiD,
ContinuousDiD, EfficientDiD):

- **Reference**: Standard Taylor linearization bootstrap (Shao 2003, "Impact of the
  Bootstrap on Sample Surveys", Statistical Science 18(2))
- **Formula**: Generate multiplier weights independently within strata at the PSU level.
  Scale by `sqrt(1 - f_h)` for FPC. Perturbation:
  `ATT_boot[b] = ATT + w_b^T @ psi_psu` where `psi_psu` are PSU-aggregated IF sums.
- **Note:** When no strata/PSU/FPC, degenerates to standard unit-level multiplier bootstrap.

**Rao-Wu Rescaled Bootstrap** (SunAbraham, TROP):

- **Reference**: Rao & Wu (1988) "Resampling Inference with Complex Survey Data",
  JASA 83(401); Rao, Wu & Yue (1992) "Some Recent Work on Resampling Methods for
  Complex Surveys", Survey Methodology 18(2), Section 3.
- **Formula**: Within each stratum *h* with *n_h* PSUs, draw `m_h` PSUs with replacement.
  Without FPC: `m_h = n_h - 1`. With FPC: `m_h = max(1, round((1 - f_h) * (n_h - 1)))`.
  Rescaled weight: `w*_i = w_i * (n_h / m_h) * r_hi` where `r_hi` = count of PSU *i* drawn.
- **Note:** FPC enters through the resample size `m_h`, not as a post-hoc scaling factor.
  When `f_h >= 1` (census stratum), observations keep original weights (zero variance).
- **Note:** SyntheticDiD joins this list via a **hybrid** pairs-bootstrap +
  Rao-Wu rescaling (PR #352). Unlike SunAbraham / TROP, which use standalone
  Rao-Wu (resample PSUs within strata and rescale weights), SDID first
  performs unit-level pairs-bootstrap (`boot_idx = rng.choice(n_total)`) and
  then slices Rao-Wu rescaled weights over the resampled units, passing them
  into a **weighted Frank-Wolfe** re-estimation of ω̂ and λ̂ per draw. The
  full objective and argmin-set caveat live in §SyntheticDiD "Note (survey +
  bootstrap composition)"; the previous fixed-ω-and-rescaled-weights path
  was removed in PR #351 and replaced with this weighted-FW derivation.
- **Note:** Bootstrap paths support all three `lonely_psu` modes: `"remove"`, `"certainty"`,
  and `"adjust"`. For `"adjust"`, singleton PSUs from different strata are pooled into a
  combined pseudo-stratum and weights are generated for the pooled group. This is the
  bootstrap analogue of the TSL "adjust" behavior (centering around the global mean).
  Applies to both multiplier bootstrap (CallawaySantAnna, ImputationDiD, TwoStageDiD,
  ContinuousDiD, EfficientDiD) and Rao-Wu bootstrap (SunAbraham, TROP).
  FPC scaling is skipped for pooled singletons (conservative). When only one singleton
  stratum exists total, pooling is not possible — the singleton contributes zero bootstrap
  variance (same as `remove`), with a `UserWarning` emitted. This is a library-specific
  documented fallback (R's analytical `adjust` uses grand-mean centering, but the bootstrap
  analogue for a single singleton is not defined in the literature). Reference: Rust & Rao (1996).
- **Deviation from R:** For the no-FPC case (`m_h = n_h - 1`), this matches R
  `survey::as.svrepdesign(type="subbootstrap")`. The FPC-adjusted resample size
  `m_h = round((1-f_h)*(n_h-1))` follows Rao, Wu & Yue (1992) Section 3.

**CallawaySantAnna Design-Based Aggregated SEs**:

- **Formula**: `V_design = sum_h (1-f_h) * (n_h/(n_h-1)) * sum_j (psi_hj - psi_h_bar)^2`
  where `psi_hj = sum_{i in PSU j} psi_i` and `psi_i` is the combined IF (standard + WIF).
- **Note:** Per-(g,t) cell SEs use the simpler IF-based formula `sqrt(sum(psi^2))` which
  already incorporates survey weights. Only aggregated SEs (overall, event study, group)
  use the full design-based variance.

**TROP Cross-Classified Strata**:

- **Note (deviation from R):** When survey strata and treatment groups both exist, TROP
  creates pseudo-strata as `(survey_stratum x treatment_group)` for Rao-Wu resampling.
  This preserves both survey variance structure and treatment ratio. Survey df computed
  from pseudo-strata structure.
- **Note:** When `survey_design.strata` is None but PSU/FPC trigger full-design bootstrap,
  TROP uses treatment group (treated vs control) as pseudo-strata for Rao-Wu resampling
  to preserve treatment ratio. FPC is applied within these pseudo-strata. This matches
  TROP's existing treatment-stratified resampling pattern.
- **Note (deviation from block bootstrap):** In Rao-Wu survey bootstrap, per-observation
  treatment effects tau_{it} are deterministic given (Y, D, lambda) because survey weights
  do not enter the kernel-weighted matrix completion. The Rao-Wu path therefore precomputes
  tau values once and only varies the ATT aggregation weights across draws. This is
  mathematically equivalent to refitting per draw and avoids redundant computation.

### Replicate Weight Variance (Phase 6)

Alternative to TSL: re-run WLS for each replicate weight column and compute
variance from the distribution of replicate estimates.

- **Reference**: Wolter (2007) "Introduction to Variance Estimation", 2nd ed.
  Rao & Wu (1988).
- **Supported methods**: BRR, Fay's BRR, JK1, JKn, SDR
- **Formulas**:
  - BRR: `V = (1/R) * sum_r (theta_r - theta)^2`
  - SDR: `V = (4/R) * sum_r (theta_r - theta)^2` (Fay & Train 1995)
  - Fay: `V = 1/(R*(1-rho)^2) * sum_r (theta_r - theta)^2`
  - JK1: `V = (R-1)/R * sum_r (theta_r - theta)^2`
  - JKn: `V = sum_h ((n_h-1)/n_h) * sum_{r in h} (theta_r - theta)^2`
- **Note:** SDR (Successive Difference Replication) uses variance factor 4/R, following Fay & Train (1995). Used by ACS PUMS (80 replicate columns). Treated identically to BRR for scaling purposes — no fay_rho, no replicate_strata, custom scale/rscales ignored.
- **IF-based replicate variance**: For influence-function estimators (CS
  aggregation, ContinuousDiD, EfficientDiD, TripleDifference), replicate
  contrasts are formed via weight-ratio rescaling:
  `theta_r = sum((w_r/w_full) * psi)` when `combined_weights=True`,
  `theta_r = sum(w_r * psi)` when `combined_weights=False`.
- **Survey df**: QR-rank of the analysis-weight matrix minus 1,
  matching R's `survey::degf()` which uses `qr(..., tol=1e-5)$rank`.
  For `combined_weights=True` (default), analysis weights are the raw
  replicate columns. For `combined_weights=False`, analysis weights are
  `replicate_weights * full_sample_weights`. Returns `None` (undefined)
  when rank <= 1, yielding NaN inference. Replaces `n_PSU - n_strata`.
- **Mutual exclusion**: Replicate weights cannot be combined with
  strata/psu/fpc (the replicates encode design structure implicitly)
- **Design parameters** (matching R `svrepdesign()`):
  - `combined_weights` (default True): replicate columns include full-sample
    weight. If False, replicate columns are perturbation factors multiplied
    by full-sample weight before WLS.
  - `replicate_scale`: overall variance multiplier, applied multiplicatively
    with `replicate_rscales` when both are provided (`scale * rscales`)
  - `replicate_rscales`: per-replicate scaling factors (vector of length R).
    BRR and Fay ignore custom `replicate_scale`/`replicate_rscales` with a
    warning (fixed scaling by design); JK1/JKn allow overrides.
  - `mse` (default False, matching R's `survey::svrepdesign()`): if True,
    center variance on full-sample estimate; if False, center on mean of
    replicate estimates. When `replicate_rscales` contains zero entries
    and `mse=False`, centering excludes zero-scaled replicates, matching
    R's `survey::svrVar()` convention.
- **Note:** Replicate columns are NOT normalized — raw values are preserved
  to maintain correct weight ratios in the IF path.
- **Note:** JKn requires explicit `replicate_strata` (per-replicate stratum
  assignment). Auto-derivation from weight patterns is not supported.
- **Note:** Invalid replicate solves (singular/degenerate) are dropped with
  a warning. Variance is computed from valid replicates only. Fewer than 2
  valid replicates returns NaN variance. The variance scaling factor
  (e.g., `1/R` for BRR, `(R-1)/R` for JK1) uses the original design's `R`,
  not the valid count — matching R's `survey` package convention where the
  design structure is fixed and dropped replicates contribute zero to the
  sum without changing the scale. Survey df uses `n_valid - 1` for
  t-based inference.
- **Note:** Replicate-weight support matrix (12 of 15 public estimators):
  - **Supported**: CallawaySantAnna (reg/ipw/dr with or without covariates,
    no bootstrap; IF-based replicate variance is covariate-agnostic),
    ContinuousDiD (no bootstrap), EfficientDiD (no bootstrap),
    TripleDifference (all methods), StaggeredTripleDifference (IF-based),
    DifferenceInDifferences (no-absorb via LinearRegression dispatch,
    absorb via estimator-level refit), MultiPeriodDiD (no-absorb via
    `compute_replicate_vcov`, absorb via estimator-level refit),
    TwoWayFixedEffects (estimator-level refit with within-transformation),
    SunAbraham (estimator-level refit, replaces `vcov_cohort`),
    StackedDiD (estimator-level refit with Q-weight composition),
    ImputationDiD (two-stage refit), TwoStageDiD (two-stage refit)
  - **Rejected with NotImplementedError**: SyntheticDiD, TROP
    (bootstrap-based variance), BaconDecomposition (diagnostic only)
  - Estimators with replicate support reject replicate + bootstrap
    (replicate weights provide analytical variance)
- **Note:** When invalid replicates are dropped in `compute_replicate_vcov`
  (OLS path), `n_valid` is returned and used for `df_survey = n_valid - 1`
  in `LinearRegression.fit()`. For IF-based replicate paths, replicates
  essentially never fail (weighted sums cannot be singular), so `n_valid`
  equals `R` in practice and df propagation is not needed.

### DEFF Diagnostics (Phase 6)

Per-coefficient design effect comparing survey variance to SRS variance.

- **Reference**: Kish (1965) "Survey Sampling", Wiley. Chapter 8.
- **Formula**: `DEFF_k = Var_survey(beta_k) / Var_SRS(beta_k)` where
  SRS baseline uses HC1 sandwich ignoring design structure
- **Effective n**: `n_eff_k = n / DEFF_k`
- **Display**: Existing weight-based DEFF labeled "Kish DEFF (weights)";
  per-coefficient DEFF available via `compute_deff_diagnostics()` or
  `LinearRegression.compute_deff()` post-fit
- **Note:** Opt-in computation — not run automatically. Users call standalone
  function or post-fit method when diagnostics are needed.

### Subpopulation Analysis (Phase 6)

Domain estimation preserving full design structure.

- **Reference**: Lumley (2004) Section 3.4. Stata `svy: subpop`.
- **Method**: `SurveyDesign.subpopulation(data, mask)` zeros out weights for
  excluded observations while retaining strata/PSU layout for correct
  variance estimation
- **Note:** Unlike naive subsetting, subpopulation analysis preserves design
  information (PSU structure, strata counts) that would be lost by dropping
  observations. This is the methodologically correct approach for domain
  estimation under complex survey designs.
- **Note:** Weight validation relaxed from "strictly positive" to
  "non-negative" to support zero-weight observations. Negative weights
  still rejected. All-zero weight vectors rejected at solver level.
- **Note:** Survey design df (`n_PSU - n_strata`) uses the full design
  structure (including zero-weight rows), ensuring variance estimation
  accounts for all strata and PSUs. The generic HC1/classical inference
  paths use positive-weight count for df adjustments, ensuring zero-weight
  padding is inference-invariant outside the survey vcov path. DEFF
  effective-n also uses positive-weight count.
- **Deviation from R:** `subpopulation()` preserves all strata in df
  computation even when a stratum has no positive-weight observations,
  while R's `subset()` drops empty strata from `survey::degf()`. For
  example, subsetting a 3-stratum design to one stratum gives df=n-3
  in diff-diff vs df=n-1 in R. Both ATT and SE match; only df (and
  therefore t-based CI width) differs. The diff-diff approach is
  conservative (more strata → lower df → wider CI) and preserves the
  full design structure per Lumley (2004) Section 3.4.
- **Note:** For replicate-weight designs, `subpopulation()` zeros out both
  full-sample and replicate weight columns for excluded observations,
  preserving all replicate metadata.
- **Note:** Estimator-level replicate refits (TWFE, SunAbraham, DiD/MultiPeriodDiD
  with `absorb`) drop zero-weight observations before weighted demeaning to
  prevent division-by-zero in within-transformation group means.  This matches
  R's `survey::withReplicates()` convention where zero-weight units are excluded
  from per-replicate estimation.  Replicates that fail despite this (e.g.,
  rank-deficient after unit deletion) are counted as invalid and excluded from
  variance computation.
- **Note:** Defensive enhancement: ContinuousDiD and TripleDifference
  validate the positive-weight effective sample size before WLS cell fits.
  After `subpopulation()` zeroes weights, raw row counts may exceed the
  regression rank requirement while the weighted effective sample does not.
  Underidentified cells are skipped (ContinuousDiD) or fall back to
  weighted means (TripleDifference).

# Practitioner Guide

The 8-step workflow in `diff_diff/guides/llms-practitioner.txt` is adapted from Baker et al. (2025)
"Difference-in-Differences Designs: A Practitioner's Guide" (arXiv:2503.13323), not a
1:1 mapping of the paper's forward-engineering framework.

- **Note:** The diff-diff canonical numbering is: 1-Define, 2-Assumptions, 3-Test PT,
  4-Choose estimator, 5-Estimate, 6-Sensitivity, 7-Heterogeneity, 8-Robustness.
  Paper's numbering: 1-Define, 2-Assumptions, 3-Estimation method, 4-Uncertainty,
  5-Estimate, 6-Sensitivity, 7-Heterogeneity, 8-Keep learning.
- **Note:** Parallel trends testing is a separate Step 3 (paper embeds it in Step 2),
  to ensure AI agents execute it as a distinct action.
- **Note:** Sources of uncertainty (paper's Step 4) is folded into Step 5 (Estimate)
  with an explicit cluster-count check directive (>= 50 clusters for asymptotic SEs,
  otherwise wild bootstrap). The 50-cluster threshold is a diff-diff convention.
- **Note:** Step 8 is "Robustness & Reporting" (compare estimators, report with/without
  covariates). Paper's Step 8 is "Keep learning." The mandatory with/without covariate
  comparison is a diff-diff convention.

### Survey DGP (`generate_survey_did_data`)

- **Note:** The `icc` parameter calibrates `psu_re_sd` using the full variance
  decomposition `Var(Y) = sigma²_psu * (1 + psu_period_factor²) + sigma²_unit +
  sigma²_noise + sigma²_cov`. When `add_covariates=True`, covariate variance
  `sigma²_cov = beta1² * Var(x1) + beta2² * Var(x2)` is included, where
  `(beta1, beta2)` defaults to `(0.5, 0.3)` but is configurable via
  `covariate_effects`.
- **Note:** When `informative_sampling=True` and `add_covariates=True`, covariate
  contributions are included in the Y(0) ranking used for weight assignment.
  Covariates are pre-drawn before the ranking step (panel: once before the loop;
  cross-section: each period) and reused in the outcome generation.
- **Note:** When `conditional_pt != 0`, the DGP creates X-dependent time trends
  that violate unconditional parallel trends while preserving conditional PT.
  Two mechanisms activate: (1) treated units' x1 is drawn from N(1, 1) instead
  of N(0, 1), creating differential covariate distributions; (2) the outcome
  includes `conditional_pt * x1_i * (t / n_periods)` for all units. Because
  E[x1 | treated] != E[x1 | control], the average time trend differs by group
  (unconditional PT fails). Conditional on x1, trends are identical (conditional
  PT holds). DR/IPW estimators with x1 as covariate recover the true ATT.
  Requires at least one ever-treated and one never-treated unit (rejected
  otherwise because the x1 mean shift only differentiates ever-treated from
  never-treated units).
- **Note:** When `conditional_pt != 0` is combined with `icc`, the ICC
  calibration is approximate. The x1 mean shift creates a mixture distribution
  with marginal Var(x1) = 1 + p_treated * (1 - p_treated) > 1, slightly
  inflating non-PSU variance and causing realized ICC to undershoot the target.
